CC: Abdominal Pain, N/V x 8 hours
HPI: The patient is a 40 year old male with a history of T1DM c/b multiple admission for DKA 2/2 
medication nonadherence and alcohol use disorder who presents with abdominal pain, nausea, 
and vomiting. 
That patient was in his usual state of health until 8 hours prior to admission when he began to 
experience abdominal pain and nausea. He vomited shortly after symptom onset. The patient 
reports drinking 6 24 oz beers and 2 pints of vodka earlier that day. Approximately 3 hours prior 
to admission, the abdominal pain markedly worsened and vomiting increased. The patient then 
described feeling lightheaded and called 911. On examination by EMS, the patient was lethargic 
and confused. He described the abdominal pain as diffuse, dull, non-radiating. It did not change 
with position. He reports he did not take his insulin today. He was brought to the ED by 
ambulance and became increasingly lethargic upon transport.

Assessment & Plan:
40 y/o male with a history of T1DM, alcohol use disorder, epilepsy, HTN, HLD, CVA in 2019 and 
L. knee septic arthritis in 4/2021 who presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting in the 
setting of binge drinking and medication non-adherence. Labs significant for AG of 33, Glu 626, 
+ ketonuria, consistent with DKA. Multiple possible foci of infection with molar abscess, possible 
pyelonephritis & L. knee septic arthritis.
#T1DM c/b DKA
- Pts DKA presentations likely 2/2 medication nonadherence in setting of heavy binge drinking. 
Need to rule out infection as a contributing cause.
- S/p insulin gtts with AG closure, switched to basal lantus
- C/w home regimen - Lantus 25u qhs, Humalog 8u TIDAC, ISS
- continue to monitor for persistent closure of AG
#Left knee pain
Likely septic arthritis in setting of S. aureus + L. knee septic arthritis in april, PTP, warmth, dec. 
ROM. However, WBC, CRP, and ESR are normal and the patient is non-toxic & afebrile, making 
this diagnosis less likely. Osteoarthritis 2/2 to septic arthritis joint also possible given temporal 
nature to event and lack of toxic presentation.
Sent Fri 7/2 8:37 PM
-Knee infection may contribute to DKA risk
- Consult ortho
- F/u knee XR, ESR, CRP
#Periapical abscess of left mandibular molar
- Dental referral
#Incidental finding on CT C/A/P - Pyelonephritis vs. b/l renal infarcts
Clinical picture fits pyelonephritis given urinary frequency, pain on urination, and CVA 
tenderness, however, urinalysis is negative for WBC, nitrite, leuko esterase making this 
diagnosis unlikely.
- Repeat urinalysis
- F/u renal DUPLEX
- f/u TTE to r/o endocarditis given history of s. aureus bacteremia 2/2 septic arthritis in setting of 
possible renal infarcts
#Alcohol use disorder
- Monitor for withdrawal symptoms, start CIWA protocol
#HTN
- Holding antihypertensives for now, monitor pressures
