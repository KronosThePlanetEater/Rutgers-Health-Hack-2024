Informant: Patient, reliable historian.
CC: "I've been short of breath while moving for 6 months and 4 days of testicular swelling"
HPI: The patient is a 34 year old male with a PMH of hypertension who was in apparent good health aside 
from obesity until 6 months ago when he began to have shortness of breath on exertion and leg swelling. 
He also reports a 4 day history of increased testicular swelling. The patient states he is able to walk about 
5 steps until he is short of breath and needs 2 pillows to prop him up to sleep at night and frequently 
wakes up at night due to shortness of breath. He denies testicular pain or any trauma and applied ice to 
his testicles without relief of swelling. He reports 1 similar incident of testicular swelling several years ago 
that resolved spontaneously. He had elevated BP in the emergency department at 745am of 178/107, but 
denied chest pain, headache, visual changes, nausea, vomiting, or back pain.

A/P: 34 year old male with PMHx of hypertension on HCTZ 25 mg daily presenting with 6 month history of dyspnea on 
exertion and lower extremity swelling and 4 day history of testicular swelling. On physical exam patient is morbidly obese 
with bilateral lower extremity swelling, 25cm diameter scrotal swelling and limited cardiac/pulm exam due to body habitus. 
BP on presentation elevated at 178/107, Troponin of 23, ProBNP of 174, CXR showing increased lung markings, EKG showed 
no acute ST changes.
#Suspected Heart Failure: Patient with persistent dyspnea on exertion and unable to lay flat at night due to SOB. Will 
evaluate cardiac function with echocardiogram and repeat troponin. Patient has not seen PMD in 1 year, will check lipid 
panel and HbA1c to establish risk stratification for statin therapy. Will consider adding additional medication management, 
Carvedilol, pending echocardiogram. Will monitor weight changes and urine output while admitted. Patient will be admitted 
for inpatient management â€“ prior to discharge, will counsel patient on diet and exercise changes, smoking cessation, and 
schedule a sleep study for evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea.
#Hypertension: On presentation to ED patient had BP of 178/107. He was treated with Furosemide 40 mg IV at 753 and 
Nitroglycerin 1 mg IVP at 807am. Repeat BP at 1230 was 235/100s, patient was started on a nitroglycerin drip at 50 mcg/min 
at 1238. BP remain elevated on nitroglycerin drip, most recent BP at 1730 was 180/110. Patient had 2.5L of yellow urine 
production. Plan to administer Lasix 40 mg IV q12hrs, hold HCTZ and begin Lisinopril 20 mg PO. Will monitor blood 
pressure closely with measurements every 15 minutes with goal blood pressure not to exceed 30% decrease within the first 
24 hours. Will follow-up with urinalysis to assess for proteinuria or possible nephrotic syndrome causing fluid retention. 
#Scrotal Swelling: Will monitor scrotal swelling after Lasix and consider scrotal sling. If swelling does not improve over the 
next 48 hours, consider testicular ultrasound to further assess scrotal swelling.
