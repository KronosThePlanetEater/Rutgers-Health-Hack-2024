
CHIEF COMPLAINT: "I feel sick with a headache and high blood pressure"
HPI: 51 year old male with 15 year history of hypertension without medication for 1 month due 
to an issue changing physicians who was in his usual state of health until 4 days ago of when he 
developed a headache associated with weakness, lethargy, and left visual field deficit described 
as a shimmering blurry spot. He describes the pain as intermittent on the back, right, and front of 
his head rated 9/10 at its worst. He went to an urgent care yesterday due to continued pain where 
he reports "his systolic BP was 204, they gave him IV meds, did a CT head, sent him home with 
Losartan and Amlodipine with his BP still systolic 200." From 9pm last night to 9am this 
morning he took 3-4 doses of his Losartan 100 mg and Amlodipine 10 mg provided by the 
urgent care due to elevated BP of 180s on his home monitor and his systolic BP was still in the 
180s prior to presentaiton. He reports no chest pain, SOB, nausea, vomiting, syncope, head 
trauma, fever, sick contacts, recent travel.
ED Course: Patient treated with Labetalol 10 mg IV and Ativan 1 mg IV. He reports relief of 
headache, now 1/10, BP still 175/104.
PMH: Hypertension, Factor V Leiden mutation
SURGICAL HISTORY: Appendectomy ~25 years ago
HOME MEDICATIONS: Losartan 100 mg daily, Amlodipine 10 mg daily, has been without 
these medication for approximately 1 month due to his primary physician retiring and not having 
a prescription refill from his new physician.
ALLERGIES: NKDA
FAMILY HISTORY: Father died in 70s of heart disease, hypertension, Mother alive and well. 2 
children age 17 and 19 without any known medical issues.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Tobacco: Remote smoking history in 20s, only a few cigarettes on social occasions 
Alcohol: Drinks 3 5% seltzers per day and occasionally has 6-7 drinks at family events

ASSESSMENT & PLAN
51 year old male with PMHx of hypertension without medication for 1 moth reporting an 
intermittent headache for 4 days associated with scotoma, lethargy and decreased sleep. Patient 
had no focal deficits on exam, was found to have elevated Trop 33, WBC at 15, Cr of 1.5, 
bicarbonate of 20.7, Potassium of 3.0, will treat and workup hypertensive emergency.

# Hypertensive Emergency
- The patient was found to be 183/104 upon presentation to the emergency department. Given 
his Systolic > 180, visual symptoms, and AKI, he meets criteria for hypertensive emergency. 
Given his lack of hypertensive medication for 1 month, hypertension may be likely due to 
medication nonadherence, although other causes including cocaine abuse given his history 
of cocaine use which can be evaluated with a urine drug screen. Hyperaldosteronism could 
also be a cause of hypertension given his hypokalemia. He has a reported history of daily 
alcohol use, although he reported only 3 5% seltzers per day and his last drink was 4 days 
ago, this may be less likely. A less common, but notable cause would be pheochromocytoma 
which could be evaluated with urine metanephrines, although his lack of palpitations or 
sweating and history of nonadherence with BP medications make this less likely on the 
differential. Blood pressure was lowered slightly with Labetalol. Given his elevated creatine, 
we will hold Losartan and treat his BP with Coreg 12.5 mg PO BID, Amlodipine 10 mg PO 
tomorrow morning, and Labetalol PRN for systolic BPs > 160 with goal MAP reduction of 
no more than 25% within the first 24 hours. The patient reported he had an unremarkable CT 
head prior to presenting to this hospital, will attempt to obtain radiology report from 
performing facility, if unable to do so in a timely manner or if patient’s condition worsens, 
will order a CT head. Given his normal neurologic exam, there is low suspicion for an 
intracerebral hemorrhage. Will order echocardiogram to evaluate for any underlying cardiac 
disease given significant hypertension. 
#Headache
- Headache pain was 9/10, now 1/10 after Ativan 1mg IV and improving of visual symptoms. 
Headache is likely secondary to hypertension, given normal neurological exam and absence 
of papilledema, there is low suspicion for intracranial pathology. Will follow-up with CT 
head report from outside facility and re-scan if unable to receive records promptly. 
#Elevated troponin
- Troponin of 33, no chest pain or SOB, no ischemic changes on EKG. There is low suspicion 
for ACS, but will re-order and trend troponin to re-evaluate. Elevated troponin could likely 
be secondary to supply demand mismatch due to hypertension.
- Will order repeat EKG.
#AKI
- Will order urine studies including urine electrolytes and trend creatine/BUN to evaluate for 
underlying kidney damage. Patient’s baseline creatine is unknown as there were no prior 
records found in the EMR.
- Will hold ACE inhibitors/ARBs for now and re-evaluate creatine/BUN tomorrow morning.
#Elevated AG Metabolic Acidosis
- WBC elevated at 15, could be secondary to hemoconcentration given elevated Hgb, will 
order lactate to further evaluate. Patient Metabolic acidosis could also be secondary to renal 
acid secretion dysfunction due to underlying kidney injury. No treatment indicated at this 
time, will re-evaluate with morning labs. 
#Hypokalemia
- Will replete with Potassium Chloride 40 meq PO and re-evaluate potassium in the morning.

Evidence Based Medicine:
Clinical Question: What are the common complications of hypertensive emergency?
Retrospective study of admitted patients at a tertiary care university hospital in Khon, Kaen 
Thailand from January 2016 – December 2019.
Patients: 1,342 patients with Hypertensive Emergency. Followed criteria set by American 
College of Cardiology/American Heart association for hypertensive emergency: SBP greater 
than or equal to 180 mmHg and/or diastolic BP greater than or equal to 120 mmHg with 
evidence of acute target organ damage including ACS, acute heart failure, stroke, intracerebral 
hemorrhage, hypertensive encephalopathy, acute aortic disease, AKI.
Most common presenting symptoms:
1) Limb weakness (24.5%)
2) Dyspnea (10.8%)
3) Impaired consciousness (8.8%)
4) Dysarthria (7.6%)
5) Headache (5.4%)
6) Generalized fatigue (5.1%)
Most common complications in the study:
1) Stroke (49.8%)
2) Acute heart failure (19.3%)
3) ACS (6.5%)
4) Acute aortic disease (2.5%)
5) Acute kidney injury (1.5%)
80% of patients were admitted, and the mortality rate of admitted patients was 1.6%. 
IV antihypertensive medication was given to 42% of patients, most common medications being 
Nitroglycerine, Nicardipine, and Labetalol.
This study provides good background information regarding the common and uncommon 
presenting symptoms and complications of hypertensive emergency. The patient in this case had 
less common presenting symptoms (headache, generalized fatigue), and complications (acute 
kidney injury). The end organ damage/complication in half of this study population was a stroke 
which is significant and highlights the importance of a thorough neurologic physical exam when 
elevating patients with severely elevated blood pressures!
