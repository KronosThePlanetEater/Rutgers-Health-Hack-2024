EBC, MS3 History and Physical
PMD: EBCHC, last seen ~2011
Location: ED, 113-B
Pt. may not be a reliable narrator, with limited health literacy and recall.
CC: right-sided abdominal pain x 24 hours
HPI: 59F with reported PMH of atrial fibrillation, CKD with ESRD on hemodyalsis 3x / week, HLD, and OSA
who presents to ED at 12 midnight with RUQ pain that awoke her from her sleep at 2 pm yesterday. Pain is 
similar to an episode ~2 months ago, immediately after falling at home. She was cooking, turn, and bumped 
into the counter, which she then fell landing on her right abdomen. She immediately went to the ED with 
RUQ pain. Pt. reports all her scans were negative at the time and she was discharged home. In the iterum 2 
months, she reports feeling 
bloated with a small amount of food with almost every meal. Does not report any triggers, including specific 
foods (fatty food, acidic foods, coffee) and position (laying flat). She has had a poor appetite, sometimes not 
eating all day, though this is not a change from baseline. She has not had any pain since her discharge. 
She reports that yesterday she awoke from a nap yesterday at 2 pm coughing and with a constant 10/10 
right-sided that felt like tightness or a “rubber band” in her belly. The pain does not radiate. A dose of 
Tylenol that afternoon did not improve her pain. A dose of Aleve a few hours later did not improve her pain. 
Some movements, including laying down, worsened the pain, but could not be recreated reliably. Last night, 
she felt bloated, vomited once (non blood, non-billious), and the pain reduced. She then decided to go to 
report to the ED. Her pain is currently a 2/10. She does not report, either currently or in this 2 months 
period, any other abdominal pain, any fever, chills, feelings of weakness, fatigue, nausea, heartburn, or 
diarrhea.
In the ED, she was found to be hyperkalemic (5.9) and given calcium gluconate (1 gm, IM) and 
demopressin (36 mcg), and transferred to the hemodialysis unit. A CT A/P was ordered.

Imaging:

CLINICAL INDICATION: R10.31 - Abdominal Pain RLQ
IMPRESSION:
1. New intramuscular hematoma expanding the right rectus abdominis muscle, possibly due to variceal 
injury.
2. Mild increase in mild to moderate volume simple ascites.
3. Diffuse anasarca.
4. Interval evolution with decrease in size of subcutaneous hematoma in the right lower ventral abdominal 
wall pannus.
5. Small moderate right pleural effusion, similar to prior.
No I&O data recorded in last 24 hours
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
59F with PMH of CHF, atrial fibrillation, CKD with ESRD on hemodyalsis HLD, and OSA who presents with 
a CC of 24-hours of RUQ. This pain is in the context of a 2-month history of early satiety after a fall, at 
which time she presented to the ED with similar RUQ pain. Review of imaging today show that a CT at the 
time of the initial fall showed an abdominal hematoma and umbilical varices. On PE today she has an 
indurated, tender region in the RUQ. CT AP today which showed continued presence of umbilical varices, 
abdominal edema, and a new, expanding hematoma in the right rectus abdominis muscle, as well as a 
decrease in size of the initial hematoma found at the time of the fall. 
# RUQ Pain, likely uncomplicated abdominal wall hematoma 2/2 umbilical varices and possible portal 
hypertension
- Differential or RUQ includes:
- Abdominal hematoma. This is the most likely etiology given her recent trauma in the area, history of 
abdominal wall hematoma and PE findings of tenderness and induration at this site, and imaging 
studies showing new hematoma and suggesting umbilical varices as likely origin of 
Document1 10/10/19
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), consistent with history of early satiety; medical history of 
obesity, OSA, no clear food or positional triggers.
- Cholangitis, consistent with PMH of obesity and early satiety, though less likely given her lack of food 
triggers (no history of pain after fatty foods) and physical exam findings (negative Murphy’s sign).
- Working diagnosis of hematoma is likely to resolve on its own.
- This is likely an uncomplicated hematoma, with no signs of infection (fever, chills, erythema, warmth), 
compartment syndrome, or anemia 2/2 continued bleeding (light-headedness, fatigue, weakness, 
expanding lesion).
- Pt. should be instructed to return to ED with any concern symptoms (as above).
- Underlying cause of hematoma may be umbilical varices as noted on CT A/P. These are likely 2/2 portal 
hypertension, and hepatic disease should be considered.
- Etiology of portal hypertension can be considered as pre-, intra-, and post-hepatic in origin.
- Post-hepatic is most likely in this cause as causes include fluid overload from CHF. Chart review from 
an admission in March revealed a diagnosis of CHF that was unknown to this patient, including an 
echocardiogram that revealed diastolic dysfunction. Plan for outpatient follow-up for CHF, including 
addition of beta-blocker to HTN regimen and continued modification of HTN regimen for blood 
pressure control and medication compliance.
- Pre-hepatic is likely portal vein thrombosis. Order abdominal ultrasound to r/o prior to discharge.
- Intrahepatic is likely schistosomiasis (uncommon in Western world) and cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is unlikely 
given her lack of CT findings, though this is a non-sensitive modality and U/S for portal vein 
thrombosis should also assess for cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is unlikely given her negative hepatic viral 
panel on previous admission in March, current alcohol intake of one drink per year (note that history of 
heavy drinking was not assessed), and normal LFTs. 
- Other causes of hematoma include a bleeding disorder, though this is less likely given her normal 
coagulation studies and the diagnosis of CHF above.
- Should be considered given her lack of other findings of CHF and fluid overload, such as SoC, 
orthopnea, and PND, and the possible explanation of her fluid overload from lack of compliance 
with hemodialysis.
- Pt. has a history of atrial fibrillation and chart review shows that she was on Eliquis. 
#ESRD with dialysis, concerning for hyperkalemia
- Pt is due for maintenance dialysis today. Will be transferred to dialysis unit for dialysis today.
- Dialysis also indicated for hyperkalemia (3.6, required calcium gluconate injection in ED) and possible 
volume overload (edema, ascites on CT A/P). Repeat CPM after dialysis. 
- Pt. should be encouraged to have better compliance with hemodialysis, including a conversation 
with pt. about possible barriers to her care including travel, time, and possible associated expenses 
not covered by insurance (such as transportation).
- Pt. has some remaining kidney function, as she is able to produce urine. Preservation of remaining 
function likely requires tighter HTN control via an improved medication compliance medication compliance
# HTN, CHF
- Echo in March 2021 showed CHF with diastolic dysfunction. 
- Pt. reports taking an unknown medication for her HTN, but has not seen a physician since 2011 and 
cannot name the medication so it is unlikely she is compliant with this medication.
- Pt. requires OP follow-up to clarify and optimize her medication regimin for HTN and CHF. BP 
control will also help preserve her remaining kidney function (see #ESRD). Will today prescribe BP 
cuff for at-home blood pressure monitoring to better assess baseline BP at follow-up appointment. 
# DM II
- Diagnoses 2011. Currently unmedicated. Random blood glucose today 95. No intervention needed.
- Consider HbA1c with additional blood draw.
