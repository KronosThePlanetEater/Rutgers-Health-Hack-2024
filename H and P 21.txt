
CC: 6 weeks of fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue 
Patient is a 78 y.o M with PMH DM, CKD, HTN, fatty liver disease, chronic lower back pain s/p titanium 
implants 2008, Gout, HLD, Hypothyroidsm and AS s/p AVR (06/2020) who presented with 6 weeks of low 
back pain, fevers, chills and 22 lbs weight loss. He states that he had a syncopal episode 6 weeks PTA
and went to an OSH where he was admitted 2 days for intravenous fluids, neuro workup (including – CT 
head) and discharged. He reports prior to the fall, he felt the same fatigue he has been feeling the past 6 
weeks. He reports after the fall, he developed new onset low back pain which radiated down his legs
described as a 5/10 which has been constant and worse with movement. His baseline backpain that 
developed in the 1980s from no apparent precipitating event is a 2/10 at baseline with no radiation. The 
pain was so severe he received nerve blocks outpatient 2 weeks PTA and was due for one 2/23. He took 
15mg of meloxicam daily and 1300mg Tylenol daily for his back pain for as long as he can remember but 
stopped 6 months PTA when he was told he had fatty liver disease by his PMD. Since then, he has been 
taking 800mg Ibuprofen daily and for the past week has been taking his nieces oxycodone 5mg. He 
reports although he has felt night sweats, chills, and feeling warm he has not checked his temperature 
at home. Symptoms have daily and worse at night. He had a dental cleaning done a two weeks prior to 
this syncopal episode and was given ciprofloxacin prior due to his Hx of TAVR and allergy to penicillin 
(see below). He also reports daily flossing but does not bleed when he flosses. He reports that he rarely 
brushes his teeth. He reports urinary frequency with no dysuria for which he follows with urology, last 
prostate exam unknown. Notes not having a bowel movement the past two days. No recent changes in 
diet. No recent travel or sick contacts. No headache, vision changes, nausea, chest pain, SOB, diarrhea, 
constipation, joint swelling, urinary/bowel incontinence or rashes.

Assessment and Plan
78 y/o male PMHx Hypothyroidism, Type II DM, AS s/p TAVR (2020), chronic low back pain, OA, 
HLD, HTN, fatty liver, gout, and GERD presenting for 6 weeks of fevers, chills, night sweats, 
fatigue anorexia and 22lb weight loss over the past 6 weeks. Lymphadenopathy, B symptoms, 
anemia, and elevated LDH concerning for malignancy vs infection. Blood cultures came back + 
for strep in chains r/o endocarditis.
Weight loss/Fevers/night sweats/Fatigue/weight loss/anorexia
-LDH 382
-two cell lines, RBC and thrombocytopenia
-Anterior cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy
-New murmur on exam
-Gram + strep bacteremia 
-Splenomegaly 
-Concerning for leukemia vs lymphoma vs endocarditis. Low plt and RBC with AOCD brings 
concern of marrow production deficits which can be seen in MM, multiple leukemias, and 
lymphomas. B symptoms, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy can also be explained by 
endocarditis or malignancy and various infections e.g. HIV, CMV, EBV
-Patient had deep cleaning dental procedure 3 months PTA but received prophylactic abx and 
an epidural once month PTA that could have introduced strep into the blood stream and 
seeded in the heart causing endocarditis that could explain these symptoms. Possibility of 
bacteremia due to immunodeficiency secondary to another underlying cause like malignancy. 
Given blood in urine, and back pain could also be MM. Less likely as patient in normocalcemic
Ba
-Will order echo, blood smear, SPEP/UPEP, electrophoresis, CT Neck/abd/pelvis. If echo -, will 
check MRI spine for source of infection
-Will check HIV/EBV/CMV
#Lower back pain
-Worsened since fall 6 weeks PTA
-Recent epidural 1 month PTA
-No signs of acute spinal compression/abscess/meningitis at this time
-Currently taking ibuprofen/meloxicam PRN for pain as outpatient
-CT lower back shows no acute changes and findings consistent with OA
-If echo is negative, consider MRI to evaluate for source of infection
-Start on 2mg morphine PRN as patient cannot move without significant pain
#Constipation
-No BM in 2 days
-Will start on mirlax and senna
-If no BM, will give enema 
Gardner Ryan H&P 2 submitted Friday 2/25 ~8 pm
#Anemia
-High ferritin, Low TIBC consistent with AOCD
-HgB 10.2
-Will continue to trend
#Elevated liver enzymes
-Drinks two martinis daily and Hx of 1300mg tylenol use daily for 3 years, stopped 6 weeks PTA
-US on liver consisted with fatty liver disease + angiomyolipoma
-Unclear etiology as we do not have baseline. Will reach out to primary
-Low concern for acute pathology, continue following as outpatient
#Thrombocytopenia
-Unclear etiology, could be secondary to hemolysis given elevated LDH or underproduction
-Will continue to monitor
#Diabetes
-Unknown HbA1C, believes last was below 7%
-Normoglycemic now 
-d/c outpatient metformin due to admission and start on sliding scale
#Hypothyroid
-TSH wnl, currently euthyroid
-Continue outpatient levo
#HTN
-BP meds not taken yesterday, will start on outpatient amlodipine
