CHIEF COMPLAINT: "I've had chest pain for 1 month"
HPI: This is a 60 year old male with history of mitral regurgitation discovered 3 months ago and
hypertension on Metoprolol who reports a 1 month history of intermittent chest pain rated 6/10 radiating
to his abdomen, back, right side of his neck, shoulder, and head. He reports the pain is intermittent,
lasting 1-2 hours and occurs at rest. He woke up at 1 am today with chest pain and was unable to sleep,
he went to work and had another episode at around 930am, he left work and came to the hospital. He
reports putting vapor rub on his chest helps with the pain and states he has been able to walk 2 km
without feeling pain or tired. He also reports a 1 year history of right shoulder pain which he believes is
from using an air gun at work. He reports no SOB, cough, nausea or vomiting.
Of note, the patient states he was in the Dominican Republic 3 months ago for 2 weeks where he saw a
cardiologist due to feeling fatigued on exertion and was told to follow-up with a cardiologist when he
returned to the USA. Outpatient records were reviewed, patient was noted to have mitral regurgitation on
exam in July 2021 and scheduled for a TEE for further evaluation which he never had completed.

ASSESSMENT & PLAN
This is a 60 year old male with a PMHx of hypertension and mitral regurgitation discovered 3 months ago 
without workup who presents with a 1 month history of intermittent chest pain radiating to his back, right 
shoulder, right neck, and abdomen occurring for 1-2 hours at a time at rest without shortness of breath. 
BP was marginally elevated 145/90, SpO2 99% on RA, physical exam was notable for 3/6 holosystolic 
murmur radiating to carotids and abdominal aorta. Serial troponins were negative, CXR showed no acute 
process, and EKG was unremarkable. Concern for unstable angina, less likely ACS given duration of 
symptoms and negative troponins, Plan for cardiac workup including TEE, cardiac catheterization to 
evaluate cardiac function.
#Chest pain
- Given the 1 month history of pain and episodes occurring at rest, there is concern for unstable 
angina. ACS is possible but unlikely given negative serial troponins and absence of significant ST 
elevations or signs of ischemia on EKG. Given abdominal radiation, GERD is possible although the 
patient stated the pain originated in the chest and radiated to the abdomen, not vice versa 
making GERD less likely. The patient stated he worked with an air gun at work, and pain could be 
due to trauma from the recoil of the gun, although there was no chest wall tenderness or signs of 
trauma and the pain has been intermittent making this unlikely. To further evaluate the chest pain 
given his presentation and family history of heart attack in his father at age 63, he should be 
evaluated for underlying CAD with cardiac catheterization and echocardiogram to evaluate for 
any heart dysfunction.
#Mitral Valve Regurgitation
- Mitral regurgitation was first reportedly first noticed 3.5 months ago by a doctor in the Dominican 
Republican, but has not been evaluated with TEE. The list of potential causes of mitral 
regurgitation is quite expansive including degenerative valve disease, Rheumatic fever, infective 
endocarditis, systemic inflammatory disorders, underlying ischemia, papillary muscle rupture, 
dilated cardiomyopathy, and calcification. Given his immigration status and recent travel to DR, 
rheumatic fever is a potential cause. He reported no sore throat or noticeable rash within the last 
6 months and rheumatic fever is not as common in the DR as it is in other immigrant populations 
such as Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, however, a distant rheumatic fever leading to 
rheumatic heart disease and mitral regurgitation is possible. Given there was no imaging done, 
and the exam demonstrating radiation of the murmur to the carotids, it is possible the murmur is 
due to aortic stenosis, although sustained hand grip would not be expected to increase the 
murmur, it would not be loudest at the apex, and it is classically a crescendo-decrescendo 
murmur. TEE is warranted to further evaluate any valvopathies and guide management and 
possible mitral valve replacement.
#Right shoulder pain
- Given the 1 year history of pain, it is likely chronic possible due to overuse given working history, 
but also could be related to chest pain. Attempt to control with Acetaminophen 650 mg PO and 
re-evaluate, at this time imaging might not be warranted given the chronic nature of pain, and 
likely outpatient follow-up with PT or MRI may be indicated. 
#Hypertension
- Continue with Metoprolol 50 mg PO.

Evidence Based Medicine
Clinical Question: What is the best treatment for Mitral Regurgitation?
Patients: Patients with grade 3+ or 4+ chronic mitral regurgitation from 37 centers in the US and Canada 
between 2005 and 2008. 
Intervention: Percutaneous repair of mitral valve
Comparison: Conventional surgery for repair or replacement of mitral valve.
Outcome: The rates of death and mitral regurgitation at 12 months were similar in both groups, however 
the rate of surgery required after percutaneous repair was substantially higher (20%) compared to 2.2% in 
the surgery group requiring repeat surgery. Major adverse events at 30 days were less common in the 
percutaneous repair group (15%) compared to the surgery group (48%) p < 0.001. Adverse events that 
were more common and statistically significant included transfusion of 2+ units of blood (13% vs 42% p < 
0.001) and mechanical ventilation for > 48 hours (0% vs 4%, p <0.02).
