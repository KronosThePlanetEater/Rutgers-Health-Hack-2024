Informant: Patient and wife, reliable
CHIEF COMPLAINT: "I noticed increased leg swelling for 4-5days and shortness of breath this morning"
HPI: This is a 74 year old male with history of chronic kidney disease, significant CAD, and newly
diagnosed colon cancer dx 2 week ago who was in his normal state of health until he developed 4-5 days
of increased lower extremity swelling and 1 day history of shortness of breath. He reports decreased
orange-colored urine output over the last day. He states he has not had the urge to urinate. He also
reports decreased appetite over the past several months. In the past year he notes a 30 pounds weight
loss, however, in the last 2 weeks reports gaining 10 pounds. His wife notes that he has had some mild
cognitive impairment within the past 1 week described as speaking and moving more slowly. He currently
does not report chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, headache, visual changes numbness or
tingling.
Of note, the patient was dx with invasive adenocarcinoma 2 weeks ago via colonoscopy and had a CT A/P
with contrast yesterday. The wife notes his Creatine was 1.7 prior to the scan and he had been drinking 2L
of water over the past 2 days, today he drank at least 1 L of water. He was scheduled to follow-up with
colorectal surgery Wednesday of this upcoming week.

ASSESSMENT & PLAN
This is a 74 year old male with a history of stage 3 CKD, CAD with CABG and 7 stents, and colon cancer 
diagnosed 2 weeks ago presenting with 4-5 day of lower extremity swelling, 10 lb weight gain over 2 
weeks, and 1 day of SOB. Patient had 2+ pitting edema 5cm distal to the tibial tuberosity, BUN 69, Cr. 27, 
Na+ 120. Trop 45 with repeat 43, proBNP 7174, CXR showed no acute abnormalities, concern for 
contrast induced acute on chronic kidney disease vs CHF and pre-renal AKI, and concern for unstaged 
colon cancer.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury
 - The patient has a history of stage 3 chronic kidney disease with a self-reported baseline creatine of 1.4 
and a self-reported rise to 1.7 just prior to his CT A/P with IV contrast. The patient was hydrating well 
prior to the CT A/P as instructed by nephrology and reports drinking at least 2 L of water 2 days prior to 
the CT A/P. The acute rise of creatine to 2.7 one day after receiving IV contrast presents strong suspicion 
and concern for contrast induced acute kidney injury possibly due to acute tubular necrosis. BUN/Cr 
ratio is 25.6 and Urine sodium < 20 mmol/L would raise suspicion for a pre-renal cause of kidney injury, 
so kidney injury secondary to underlying cardiac disease is also possible although Urine osmolality is 318 
leading more towards an intrinsic kidney etiology. Obstructive cause of injury should be ruled out with a 
bladder scan and renal US given history of oliguria. Nephrology should also be notified to consult on this 
case given history of kidney disease and will defer to nephrology regarding decision of dialysis.
#CHF
- proBNP 7174 with significant coronary history and risk factors, positive troponin, and leg edema 
provide concern for CHF. This will be evaluated with echocardiogram and will consider diuresis once 
renal abnormalities are further investigated and repeat BUN/Cr is complete. EKG should be promptly 
evaluated given elevated troponin, however, there is less concern for ACS given serial troponins not 
trending upward. 
#Colon Cancer
- Invasive adenocarcinoma was diagnosed on colonoscopy 2 weeks ago, but staging has not yet been 
completed. Will follow-up with results of CT A/P for evaluation of metastasis possibly contributing to 
symptoms and consult colorectal surgery for any input. 
# Hyponatremia
- Could be secondary to renal disease or heart failure or SIADH, will further evaluate with echo/renal US 
and re-draw labs this evening. 
#Normocytic Anemia
- Hgb 8.4, MCV was WNL, did not report dark or bloody stool, could be related to underlying malignancy, 
will f/u on CT A/P results and monitor for worsening hemodynamic stability.

#Non-specific neuro symptoms
- The patient has a 4 day history of weakness, fatigue, and decreased cognition with concern for uremic 
encephalopathy. He also had minor head trauma a few days ago. CT head was ordered and showed no 
evidence of masses or hemorrhage, making metastasis or intracranial hemorrhage unlikely. Will continue 
to monitor for worsening of neurologic symptoms. 
Evidence Based Medicine
Clinical question: Does hydration prior to IV contrast help protect against contrast-induced 
nephropathy? 
Patients: 350 patients undergoing coronary angiography from 3/19/10-6/22/10 in Madani Heart 
Hospital, Tabriz, Iran. 
Intervention: Treatment with Sodium bicarbonate 6 hours before and after infusion of contrast.
Comparison: Treatment with Normal Saline 6 hours before and after infusion of contrast. 
Outcome: Hydration with sodium bicarbonate has more protective effects when compared to hydration 
with normal saline in the incidence of contrast-induced AKI. CIN was seen in 19.4% of patients receiving 
normal saline vs 6.9% of patients receiving sodium bicarbonate (p = 0.001).
Mahmoodi K, Sohrabi B, Ilkhchooyi F, Malaki M, Khaniani ME, Hemmati M. The Efficacy of Hydration 
with Normal Saline Versus Hydration with Sodium Bicarbonate in the Prevention of Contrast-induced 
Nephropathy. Heart Views. 2014;15(2):33-36. doi:10.4103/1995-705X.137489
This study is relevant to this case as the patient likely experienced contrast induced nephropathy after 
his CT A/P with contrast. This study provides evidence for the benefit of pre- and post-treatment with 
sodium bicarbonate in reducing the incidence of CIN when compared to normal saline. Although this 
patient did not receive IV fluids prior to the CT A/P, he did drink fluids orally 2 days prior to the imaging 
study. Given the logistical limitations of treating patients with IV fluids prior to imaging, a follow-up 
study examining oral hydration vs IV hydration with sodium bicarbonate prior to a contrast load would 
be interesting to see!
