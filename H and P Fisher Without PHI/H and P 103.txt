CHIEF COMPLAINT:
“My gums started bleeding Saturday morning.”
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. is a 45 y.o. female with a history of Protein C and Protein S deficiency who was in apparent 
good health until 2013 when she developed her first left lower extremity DVT, which was treated with 
Warfarin for one year. Patient's second left lower extremity DVT occurred in 2016 and has been 
maintained on Warfarin ever since. Today, patient presents to ED after an episode of gingival bleeding, 
which began on 8/13/22. Initially patient noticed metallic taste and red tinted saliva in the morning. By 
the end of the day, the patient had bleeding from the gums. No other sites of active bleeding reported. 
Patient does not report fatigue, lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath, hematemesis, 
hematochezia, melena, hematuria or recent trauma. Patient does not have history of pulmonary 
embolism, spontaneous abortion, or CVA. Patient has never had episode of similar symptoms in the past 
and presented to ED since she is aware of risk of bleeding on warfarin. 
Of note, patient immigrated from Jamaica in 2018. She is not currently followed by PCP and obtains 
Warfarin from Jamaica, which she is able to obtain at low cost. Patient tests her INR regularly at Quest 
Diagnostics (pays $39 out-of-pocket) and adjusts her Warfarin dose herself as needed to reach 
therapeutic target of 2-3. Currently, she is on Warfarin 5 mg alternating with 7.5 mg every other day. 
Previously she was on Warfarin 3 mg alternating with 3.5 mg every other day, but increased dose in 
2/2022 as her INR was subtherapeutic (1.34) and ultrasound showed superficial thrombophlebitis. 
In the ED, patient was found to have INR of 11.98 and 3+ blood and 166 RBCs on urinalysis. Patient 
attributes supratherapeutic INR to taking Tylenol 1 g QID for back pain a week prior to admission. In the 
ED, patient's Warfarin was held and she was given 1 dose of Vitamin K 2.5 mg PO with subsequent 
decrease in INR to 10.63. On 8/14/22, patient was given second dose of Vitamin K 5 mg IV with 
subsequent decrease in INR to 2.24. Patient is currently being followed by Hematology.

IMAGING, AND OTHER STUDIES:
CT Abdomen and Pelvis without Contrast from 8/13/22: No evidence of nephronureterolithiasis. Nonspecific bilateral perinephritic stranding, slightly greater on the right but no 
hydronephrosis. Otherwise no evidence of acute abdominal/pelvic findings.
US Venous Duplex Bilateral Lower Extremity from 8/14/22: On the left, there is a superficial 
thrombophlebitis of the small saphenous vein. On the right, there is no evidence of deep or superficial 
venous thrombosis.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
 is a 45 y.o. female with Protein C and Protein S deficiency and history of recurrent DVTs 
currently self-maintained on warfarin who presented with one episode of gingival bleeding and found to 
have supra-therapeutic INR and hematuria on urinalysis upon admission.
#Protein C and S Deficiency, Subtherapeutic INR, Bleeding Gums
Patient is not followed by PCP and self-titrates warfarin based on INR. Following superficial 
thrombophlebitis of LLE and subtherapeutic INR of 1.34 in 2/2022, patient increased warfarin dose to 5 
mg and 7.5 mg every other day. Recently started taking Acetaminophen 1 g QID for back pain. Presented 
to ER 1 week later with bleeding gums and supratherapeutic INR of 11.98. Venous duplex ultrasound
Submitted Wed 8/15 10:29 pm
showed no evidence of DVT. s/p Vitamin K 2.5 mg PO in ED, Vitamin K 5 mg IV 8/14/2022 and currently 
holding warfarin.
Gum bleeding most likely due to supratherapeutic INR secondary to recent acetaminophen use. Several 
case reports have demonstrated a temporal increase in INR in patients taking warfarin concomitantly 
with acetaminophen 1-4g/day. Less likely etiology includes Vitamin C deficiency (Scurvy) as dermatologic 
manifestations (follicular hyperkeratosis, coiled corkscrew hairs) and gingivitis were not appreciated on 
exam, patient is not anemic, and she reports eating balanced diet. Other differential including trauma, 
aggressive tooth brushing, or bleeding secondary to malignancy are less likely as symptoms occurred 
spontaneously while driving in the morning and she does report any constitutional symptoms. 
- Heme/Onc currently following. Recommendations as per heme/onc:
- Continue to hold Warfarin. 
- Goal INR 2.5-3.5, continue to trend.
- Recommend Xarelto 20 mg QD. If unable to obtain direct anticoagulant, okay to discharge 
patient on Warfarin with close outpatient monitoring. 
- For Protein C and S deficiency, few data is available to fully support the use of DOACs 
over Warfarin so the decision is individualized and based on several factors (severity of 
thrombosis, patient preference, and adherence therapy). Patient is currently uninsured, 
obtaining Warfarin from Jamaica, and paying out-of-pocket to check INR. Based on 
these factors, patient will benefit most from direct oral anticoagulant, which requires 
less frequent lab monitoring and costs less - according to 340B formulary and 
medication optimization pharmacist, patient can receive one month supply of Xarelto 
for free then $0.28 per month thereafter. If patient is agreeable to starting Xarelto, will 
contact social work and medication optimization team to coordinate enrollment to 340B
program. 
- Will coordinate follow-up care at Chandler Clinic.
#Lower Back Pain
Bilateral paraspinal tenderness for 1 week, spasmic in quality. On exam, no CVA or spinal tenderness, 
negative straight leg raising. No improvement with lidocaine patch, resolved with Cyclobenzaprine. Most 
concerning for muscular strain, due to quality of pain and improvement with muscle relaxant. Renal 
etiology is less likely due to negative CT (no nephrolithiasis or hydronephrosis). Neurologic etiology is 
less likely since no focal deficits, radiating symptoms or negative straight leg raising on exam. 
- Conservative management - heat and massage area
- Continue Cyclobenzaprine 5 mg Q8Hours

EBM: 
 Overall objective of this study was to investigate the use of direct oral anticoagulants in venous 
thromboembolisms and thrombophilia. 
 Patient population: Patients with thrombophilia disorders + venous thromboembolic events and
bleeding events. 
o Thrombophilia disorders included antithrombin, protein C and protein S deficiencies, factor 
V leiden, or PT G20210A mutation, and antiphospholipid syndrome. 
 My patient has both protein C and S deficiencies 
 Intervention: direct anticoagulants (dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, apixaban)
 Comparison: vitamin K antagonists (such as warfarin)
 Outcome 
o Primary outcome – recurrent venous thromboembolisms
o Safety outcomes – major bleeding and major/clinically relevant non-bleeding events 
 In summary, this study found that there was no significant difference in venous thromboembolic 
recurrences between patients treated with direct anticoagulants (DOAC) versus vitamin K 
antagonists (VKA). In terms of safety profiles, there was no significant difference in risk of major 
bleeding in patients with thrombophilia treated with DOAC vs VKA. In the subgroup analysis that 
was more specific and applicable to my patient, the study found that the rates of venous 
thromboembolic recurrence and clinically relevant bleeding in patients with protein S and protein C 
deficiency were low in patients receiving both DOACs and VKA, however this result was limited by 
low number of events. Because of this limitation, few data is available to fully support the use of 
DOACs in the treatment of venous thromboembolic events in patients with Protein C and Protein S 
deficiency. Therefore, factors such as patient preference, adherence to medication, stability of INR, 
and cost (most important and applicable to my patient) should be considered when choosing an 
anticoagulant. 
 Direct oral anticoagulants offer distinct advantages including fixed doses, predictable response, 
fewer drug and food interactions, lack of routine INR monitoring and better safety profile to vitamin 
K antagonists (such as warfarin). In addition to these advantages, this study shows that direct oral 
anticoagulants were overall safe and effective in patients with venous thromboembolism and 
thrombophilia. Taking both these factors into consideration and my patient’s history (monthly INR 
monitoring, recent possible drug interaction, lack of insurance, concern for cost), discharging her on 
a direct anticoagulant is appropriate for her care.
