SUBJECTIVE: 
Patient is a 55 y/o male with PMH of COPD, L-CHF, CAD and MI, DM2 and TIA/CVA who 
presents with SOB with exertion after walking 5 feet which he noticed 1 day ago. He is a 
former 90 pack year smoker but quit 5 years ago. He denies any sick contacts or recent 
travel out of the country. He notes he lives in apartment and is visited by his ex partner 
who monitors if he took his at home albuterol, oxygen breathing treatments and other 
medications. One week before admission, patient noticed an episode of coughing up 
black to reddish tinged sputum which then changed to his baseline yellow-clear frothy 
appearance. He notes dyspnea at rest while sitting and when speaking to his partner over 
the phone. He prefers to sit up right then lay supine on bed and did not sleep last night 
because of SOB when supine. He notes continued chest "tightness" with exertion when 
moving from bed to chair. He feels that this may be due to his left sided CHF. Denies any 
nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Denies any dysuria or hematuria. Notes 1 bowel movement 
this morning and denies any blood in stool. He reports continued edema in bilateral 
forearms and lower extremities from last visit in June 2022.

Submitted Friday 16 Sep 2022 1:15 pm
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
# Acute on chronic COPD exacerbation
- solumedrol held and should switch to 4 day course of prednisone 40 mg starting today 
- c/w ellipta, singular 
#Left sided CHF
- 6/22 showed EF of 45-50%
- Patient states he feels there is bilateral UE and LE edema and on Exam there is 3+pitting 
edema in b/l LEs
- New echo could measure if EF decreased but it probably did not decrease by much in 
last 3 months. However, increased QT interval in last ECG, another reading should be 
recorded to rule out worsening of this. 
- He should c/w metoprolol succinate 50 mg tid
- Spironolactone 50 mgqd
- Torsemide 60 mgbid held, IV lasix raised to 80 mg q12 should help decrease UE and LE 
edema
- c/w ertugliflozin podolate 5 mg 
#Anemia of chronic disease with iatrogenic iron deficiency anemia 
- On last admission, anemia of chronic disease with iron deficiency found 
- Today, rbc 4.2, hgb 9.9 and hematocrit 35.1 is uptrending 
- 9/15/ Iron: 25*, Iron saturation: 6*, TIBC: 449*, UIBC: 424.0 show that iron defiency 
anemia is worsening, should c/w ferrous sulfate 325 mgqd
- Ganzoni Equation for Iron Deficiency Anemia show that his total iron deficit is 1,382 mg 
and ID is known to be prevalent In 1/3 of COPD patients and associated with lower FEV1 
and FVC.
#Pneumonia due to Klebsiella Pneumoniae 
- Patient notes he had one episode of productive cough with black-reddish tinged sputum 
about 5 days ago but has not been able to cough up more sputum overnight. This sounds 
like an episode of "currant" jelly sputum which is pathognomic for klebsiella pneumonia 
infection. 
- CXR showed mild bibasilar atelectasis so an additional and WBC count from 9/15/22 
show 10.45 which is uptrending from 9.26 1 day ago and 6.8 2 days ago. CXR may be 
warranted to rule out community aquired pneumoniae. However inc wbc count may be 
due to 1st dose of prednisone 40 mg which was given on 9/15 at 9 am. Can follow up 
with nurse if it was given. 
- Monitor temperature, 2 days ago his temperature was not being measured but I 
measured sublingually and was afebrile. 
# RA
- c/w methotrexate
Submitted Friday 16 Sep 2022 1:15 pm
#DM
- c/w Lantus 18, humalog 5 tid and monitor blood glucose levels since will start 4 day 
course of prednisone
#CAD, MI in past
- continue Atorvastatin 40 mg 
- Cardiology should be consulted since it has been difficult to auscultate heart sounds
#OSA- BiPAP at night and is currently on 4L NC during day 
#GERD- c/w pantoprazole 40 every day
#BPH- c/w flomax 0.4mgqd
