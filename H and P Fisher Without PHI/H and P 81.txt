Reliability: “Good” 
CC: “I have been having trouble breathing for the last 4 days”
HPI: He is an 82 year old male who had been in usual state of health with well controlled diabetes and 
hypertension until symptom onset. He had his flu shot last Thursday (5 days ago) and believes that this 
started his symptoms. Yesterday he visited an Urgent Care and is on home Prednisone 50 mg. This has 
not improved his symptoms. At baseline, he does not have any shortness of breath, and is not on home 
oxygen. He does not have any known lung conditions and has a five year smoking history from his early 
20s. However, he is prescribed breo-ellipta and albuterol as home medications.
He also has developed a cough with white sputum. He has had some chills and sweats. He does not have 
any headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, back pain, leg swelling, or calf pain. Medics en route 
reported a 92% SPO2 on RA and noticed wheezing and tachypnea. They administered Solumedrol 125 
mg IV and DuoNeb. Symptoms did not change remarkably. 
In the ED, the patient tested positive for RSV. He also had an elevated troponin (0.14) and proBNP 
(3000). An EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm. A chest x ray showed no abnormalities such as an effusion. 
He was placed on a nonrebreather mask with 50% flow rate and stayed at 92% SPO2. An ABG was drawn 
and all values were within normal limits, besides pO2 which was at 73 with low normal beginning at 74.

Summary: 
In summary this is an 82 year old gentlemen who is RSV positive with elevated troponin, a remote 
smoking history, and no diagnosed lung conditions who presents with a four day history of shortness of 
breath which is not resolving on a rebreather or on his home steroid course. He has a clear chest xray
and is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
# acute hypoxic respiratory failure
- diff diagnosis: RSV, COPD exacerbation, asthma exacerbation, PE
- Patient says he has no chronic lung conditions, just currently bronchitis, however, is taking a number of 
pulmonary medications which suggest otherwise, I.e. breo ellipta, albuterol. We will reach out to his 
primary care physician (he follows with family medicine) to clarify if this is correct.
- elevated troponin and positive RSV,clear cxr, no elevated WBC, satting mid 90s on 50% 12 L Ventimask, 
ABG wnl, EKG ordered show premature atrial contractions but otherwise normal 
- d dimer ordered with likely CTA to follow 
- started on Duo-Neb, budesonide
- c/w methylprednisolone from outpatient
# elevated troponin 
- trend troponin, repeat order placed 
- possibly heart strain due to PE 
# lactate 
- elevated lactate in setting of hypoxemia 
- normal anion gap currently, 15 
# t2dm 
- switched to sliding scale insulin, hold home metformin 
- currently hyperglycemic 
# hyponatremia 
- NS 
# hypokalemia
- replete with oral potassium chloride 
# tachycardia 
- c/w home metoprolol for now as he is in the high normal range with most recent HR at 97
