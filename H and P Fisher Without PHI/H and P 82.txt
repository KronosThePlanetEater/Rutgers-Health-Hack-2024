HPI 
A 75 y.o. female with a pmh of TIA, recurrent syncope and HTN who presents with two episodes 
of syncope today. The first was in bed at approximately 3 AM and the second was when getting 
up and going to the bathroom around 7 am. This is the first time she has ever had two in the 
same day, and the latter was the longest one she has ever had, estimated to be between 10 and 
15 minutes by her husband who witnessed them both. She normally has two of these "attacks" 
a year. She has no memory of them. She is fatigued after each event. No headache. No 
confusion. The episodes are not preceded by an aura but sometimes there is lightheadedness 
beforehand, but usually by surprise. She can be awakened from these episodes by splashing 
cold water on her and by tapping her face. She believes these are distinct from the TIA which 
she had one month ago. She visited a neurologist approximately 10 years ago and there was no 
diagnosis. 
Her husband states that she has had a poor memory since last spring (6 months), primarily
affecting her short term memory. He says that she is occasionally non-responsive when they 
talk to her. She is like a "rubber doll". There was one episode last week where she was getting 
dressed and putting on tights over her jeans after being told that didn't make sense. She does 
not remember these episodes. She has had a change in gait over the last year. She is somewhat 
stooped and takes small steps. Recently, her knees locked up and she could not stand or move. 
There is no tremor.

IMAGING, AND OTHER STUDIES:
US Carotid Duplex Bilateral
Conclusions: MINIMAL CAROTID DISEASE BILATERALLY WITH STENOSIS IN THE RANGE OF 0-
15%. 
Right: Complete Duplex imaging of the extracranial carotid arteries was performed with B-Mode 
imaging, color flow analysis, and Doppler Spectral waveform analysis. B-mode imaging reveals 
minimal to no plaque in the carotid system. Color flow analysis reveals symmetric uniform 
antegrade flow. Spectral waveforms are normal with a normal spectral window and normal flow 
velocities. PSV in the ICA is < 100 cm/sec. The vertebral artery displays antegrade flow with 
normal flow velocities. 

These findings are consistent with a 0-15% stenosis of the internal carotid artery.

CT Head Without Contrast
Narrative: EXAM: CT HEAD WO CONTRAST
CLINICAL INDICATION: Syncope, recurrent; Mental status change, unknown cause;
TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the head were obtained without intravenous contrast. Sagittal 
and coronal reconstructions were performed. CT was performed using one or more dose 
reduction techniques including automated exposure control, adjustment of the mA and/or kV 
according to patient size, and/or use of iterative reconstruction technique.
COMPARISON: MRI 10/5/2022 and CT scan 10/4/2022.
Count of known CT scans and NM Myocardial Perfusion studies in last 12 months (Quality 
Measure G9321): 1
FINDINGS: 
Ventricles/Extra-axial Spaces: Normal for age.
Brain Parenchyma: No acute intracranial hemorrhage. No acute territorial infarction. No mass 
effect or midline shift. Supratentorial white matter low density likely representing moderate 
chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
Calvarium: Within normal limits.
Paranasal Sinuses: Mucosal thickening left sphenoid sinus. 
Mastoids: Minimal right mastoid fluid. Middle ear cavities and external auditory canals are 
normally aerated.
Orbits: Visualized portions unremarkable.
Other: No other significant findings.
Impression: Atrophy. White matter changes. Minimal sinus disease and right mastoid fluid. No 
bleed. No mass. No shift. No infarct. No change.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
# recurrent syncope 
Diff: seizures, absence seizures, vasovagal, cardiac syncope, Alzheimer’s, CJD, Parkinson’s, Lewy 
Body Dementia, vascular dementia
- recommend EEG 
- Consult to neurology 
- Atrophy and White matter changes evident on head CT 
- Order MRI per neurology to get better view of the white matter changes (recent one one 
month ago s/p tia)
- f/u urinalysis 
- q4 neruo checks 
- telemetry 
- Vascular dementia supported by the history of TIA one month ago and relatively fast memory 
loss since the spring 
- follows with cardiologist, saw yesterday for normal echo, scheduled for carotid duplex Friday 
but performed today and also normal. No known arrhythmias
- ordered orthostatic blood pressures, but seems unlikely given the high blood pressure at rest. 

# memory changes

Panayiotopoulos CP. Treatment of typical absence seizures and related epileptic 
syndromes. Paediatr Drugs. 2001;3(5):379-403. doi: 10.2165/00128072-200103050-
00006. PMID: 11393330.
Appraise: 
The author was a leader in epilepsy research holding joint appointments at Harvard, the 
University of Western Australia and St. Thomas Hospital, London. 
Advise: 
Absence seizures can be diagnosed by clinical features or by 3 or 4 hz spikes and slow wave 
forms on EEG. They can have a combination of motor and autonomic dysfunction. Motor 
movements primarily affect the mouth. This is similar to our patient, as the husband said that if 
there are any movements, they involve the mouth twitching or jaw clenching. 
Interestingly, absence seizures can be induced in those afflicted through hyperventilation in 
90% of patients. Lately, video games have become an increasing prevalent trigger. Other 
triggers include bright lights or sounds, but it is equally frequent to have no trigger at all. Our 
patient believes that heat may have something to do with her episodes. 
Absence seizures are more prevalent in the pediatric population. It is possible people outgrow 
the condition. 10 to 15% of adults who have epilepsy will have absence seizures. 

As far as treatment, there are three first line therapies including valproic acid, ethosuximide, 
and lamotrigine. Of these, ethosuximide can be used only in patients who have exclusively 
absence seizures, and no other type. Their efficacy ranges between 50 and 75% when used as 
monotherapies. Lamotrigine combined with valproic acid can be used when monotherapy is not 
sufficient. Clonazepam and acetazolamide can also be used as adjunctive agents.
