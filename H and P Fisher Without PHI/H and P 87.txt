Patient is unreliable, difficulty with word finding secondary to AMS. History from Husband
 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Altered mental status that started yesterday
HPI: PG is a 82 y.o. female with a PMH of Factor V Leiden Mutation, prior history of 
multiple pulmonary embolisms, HTN, Paroxysmal Afib on Xarelto and HLD who 
presented with husband after being found confused in her home yesterday. The
following history is obtained from husband. The patient woke up in her usual state of 
health until approximately 3pm, when she was sitting with her husband in living room 
when she got up to go to her bedroom, but instead walked in the wrong direction. When 
questioned by her husband, pt appeared confused and was unable to find the correct 
way. Upon further questioning, pt was unable to identify her husband and then began 
repeating the phrase “I beg you” multiple times. EMS was called given concern for stroke.
Per the patient's husband, patient baseline mental status is usually oriented to person, 
time and place and can independently perform ADLs but notes over the last 2 years, she
has increased frequency of difficulty with word finding with use of repetitive phrases like, 
“I beg you” when under anxiety or stress. For example, 8 months ago when the husband 
and daughter were arguing, the patient started to repeat “I beg you” for 10 minutes until 
the argument ceased. He notes a total of 4 episodes like this over the last 1.5 years.
However, this most recent episode in September 22, 2022 was unprovoked and she did 
not recognize him and was disoriented so they went to their local hospital for which she 
underwent CT of head and neck and MRI of brain with no signs of acute stroke and was
diagnosed with TIA and prescribed Aspirin. 
Additionally, husband notes she urinates 8-10xday with difficulty starting steam without 
dysuria or hematuria. Given these urinary symptoms, husband is concerned for UTI and
gives her cranberry pills every day. He does not report that she has had any recent 
episode of dysuria, or hematuria. As per husband's report, he did not notice evidence of 
tongue lacerations or urinary or fecal incontinence yesterday afternoon or today. Also, 
the husband does not report that she has any recent sick contacts, fever, chills or cough 
within the last several weeks. She has no history of changes in vision, weakness in upper 
or lower extremities and difficulty with swallowing foods or liquids. 
Upon arrival in the ED, vitals were WNL except for BP of 170/80 which improved without 
intervention to 140/60s with signs of difficulty with word finding and repetitive phrases 
when questioned. A code stroke was called but CT head showed no acute ischemia or 
infarction. NIHSS scale was 0 and she was administered Lorazepam injection for agitation 
against the healthcare staff. Upon my visit in the ED, patient was unable to respond to 
questions and said "no" when I asked if she is feeling headache, neck pain or suprapubic 
pain and later started to repeat "I beg you".

Assessment and Plan
Summary Statement: PG is a 82 y.o. female with a PMH of TIA, Afib on Xarelto, Factor V 
leiden mutation, hx of prior multiple PE, HLD, HTN who presents for AMS. 
#Altered mental status
Patient’s altered mental status most likely secondary to acute toxic metabolic 
encephalopathy from UTI. From history, patient is noted to urinate 8-10xday with 
difficulty starting urination while on exam, suprapubic tenderness was elicited and on UA 
there were increased WBC and leukocytes which makes UTI likely. Other causes of ATME 
may be unlikely since blood glucose was 109 and there were no reports of hypoglycemia 
during triage. Also, Labs showed normal sodium, potassium with no evidence of uremia 
and normal transaminases ruling out hepatic encephalopathy. Also, TSH, B12 and folate 
were normal. 
- Plan repeat CMP, CBC and Treat with Ceftriaxone until urine culture returns for 
more specific treatment. Most common pathogen of lower UTI is E.coli and CTX 
would cover that pathogen.
#Stroke
Stroke as a cause of her AMS is less likely since her NIHHS score was 0 and CT Head and Brain 
MRI showed no signs of acute hemorrhage or infarct. She does have increased risk of stroke of 
because of her Afib but she has been compliant with Aspirin and Xarelto. 
- Plan for new MRI to rule out acute hemorrhage or infarct missed on CT
#Seizure
From the history, seizure is less likely due to no reports of tongue laceration and hx of urinary or 
fecal incontinence in the past after periods of confusion and with this recent episode. However, 
seizure can present with episodes of repetitive word phrases so a short term or 24 hr EEG can 
increase the chance of noting seizure activity. 
Chronic problems
#Afib
- Currently in NSR and on exam did not observe irregularly irregular rhythm. 
- Recent echo in 9/2022 showed no signs of reduced LVEF or LA dilation. 
- She should c/w Sotalol and Xarelto
- Should continue with telemetry to observe rhythm
#HLD
- Order lipid profile for basal LDL levels
- Continue home simvastatin 20 mg
Submitted Wed 2022 10 12 ~8:30 pm
#HTN
- Patient was Hypertensive in ED and today was 141/74 on exam. Showed no signs of end 
organ dysfunction.
- C/W home/Continue home amlodipine, clonidine, valsartan, HCTZ
#Overactive Bladder
- Per history from husband, notes she urinates 10 xday and takes cranberry pills everyday 
for UTI ppx.
- In the future once stable, can discuss increasing dose of Tolterodine or switching to 
Mirabegron.
