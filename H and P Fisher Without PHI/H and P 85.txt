Data Source: Patient, reliable 
Chief complaint: Fever, chills and productive cough for the last 2 days
History of Present Illness: 
JS is a 82 y.o. female with PMH of HTN, Asthma, COPD, uterine cancer (in 
20s), DVT of LEs (2017), stress induced cardiomyopathy (07/2021), and 
possible coronary vasospasm vs NSTEMI (09/01/22) who is presenting with 
fever, chills, productive cough with yellow-green sputum, nausea and vomiting
since Saturday morning 9/24/22. She does not report any sick contacts or 
recent travel out of the country and notes she spends most of her time home. 
She notes her son who lives at home with her had a cough as well but not 
feeling similar symptoms. She notes that on Saturday she was vomiting
material that was non bloody and dark in color all night but has not vomited 
since then. She is unsure how many times she vomited. 
She notes 2 months of intermittent left sided chest pain and was hospitalized 
for possible coronary vasospasm vs NSTEMI (09/01/22). She describes this 
pain as more of a tightness with no specific trigger. Troponin during that time 
was 179 with no significant EKG changes and prior cath in 7/2021 showing no 
significant CAD and was discharged with metoprolol tartrate 12.5 BID po and 
atorvastatin 40 mg po daily. 
For the ER visit on 9/24/22, her vitals were significant for BP initially 102/50 
and dropped to 70s-80s/40s, given 2 additional Liters IVFs with improvement. 
Also, max temperature was 100.1F with WBC 27.4, lactate 1.1 after 1L of 
fluids. Labs include NA 131, CL 94, Cr 1.0, bicarb of 20.9 and AG 16 with 
negative troponins and procalcitonin level of 1.1. COVID and Influenza were 
negative and CXR showed left perihilar opacity.
There was an acute event overnight in which she was hypotensive (BP of 
85/48) while using her inhaler while laying down, she does not report getting 
up from bed. She does not report any dizziness or SOB with this hypotensive 
episode. She notes that after the episode she has continued left anterior chest 
pain but notes this is intermittent since recently being diagnosed with NSTEMI 
and coronary vasospasm in 9/2/2022. She was given 0.5 L bolus of LR with 
improvement of blood pressure to above 100/60 consistently. Troponins were 
negative and there was no change in new EKG from the previous one. This 
morning, she does not report chest pain but notes continued chest tightness 
and productive cough with yellow sputum. She does not report any lower leg 
edema. Also, she reports new right handed numbness since Saturday at the 
onset of symptoms. She does not report any nausea or vomiting overnight or 
Submitted Wednesday, 2022 09 28 1:30 pm
this morning. She had a bowel movement this morning with no pain or visible 
blood in the stool and does not report dysuria or hematuria. She does not 
report any loss of smell or taste and is eating solid food without nausea or 
vomiting. Today, she reported that she has a history of TB when she was a 
teen or young adult.

IMAGING, AND EKG
Chest XR 9/25/22
Summary: Left perihilar opacity may reflect pneumonia or asymmetric edema 
ECG, 9/25/22: Sinus rhythm with frequent premature ventricular complexes. 
Right BBB seen in V1-V2. No significant change from ECG in 9/3/22. 
Summary Statement: 
Patient is an 80-year-old female nonsmoker with past medical history of 
asthma, 
HTN, and remote history of breast cancer who presents with subacute, 
progressive 
dyspnea on exertion. Physical exam is notable for mild hypoxia, and CTA of 
chest 
shows extensive bilateral PEs. 
A/P
#Sepsis
- Patient presented with Tmax of 100.1 and hypotensive on admission and 
last night was hypotensive to 70s/40s can point towards sepsis. 
- Her physical exam was significant for expiratory wheezing and CXR shows 
left perihilar PNA with leukocytosis of 27.4, procal of 1.1 suggest signs of 
bacterial or viral infection. 
- Peripheral blood cultures are pending but were taken after starting Zosyn. 
- If strep pneumoniae antigen is positive, which is a common pathogen that is 
associated with pneumonia in her age population, we can start treating with 
Azithromycin or Ceftriaxone po. 
- In total she has been given 3L fluids before her hypotensive episode on 9/25 
and .5L bolus LR after this episode. Would want to monitor IVF since she 
does have a history of cardiomyopathy but no lower leg edema noted today. 
- Continue LR 75 ml/hr and f/u blood pressures every hour if possible.

#HAP vs CAP 
- CAP may be less likely since she states she barely leaves her home, 
however her son has had a cough and leaves the home for work. 
- In terms of HAP, Her hospital stay earlier this month puts her at risk for 
acquiring left perihilar PNA, alongside her presentation of cough, fever, chills, 
SOB. 
- She is COVID and Flu negative but would want to work up strep pneumo 
since that is common in her age population and legionella because of 
associated hyponatremia. Sputum culture is ordered. 
- Antibiotics, Zosyn started yesterday 9/25 to treat possible bacterial PNA
- Sudafed and mucinex can help with chest congestion and to expel enough 
mucous for sputum sample and therapeutic purposes. 
- f/u lactate, blood culture, U/A with culture 
#Possible COPD exacerbation
- She has history of COPD with 26 pack year smoking history so this PNA 
may put her at risk for COPD exacerbation. Incentive spirometer can help 
prevent atelectasis and facilitate improvement in air movement into and out of 
the lungs. 
- She is started on 4L NC oxygen, duonebs and now, prednisone po 40 mg 
every day for 5 days may help with the poor air movement found on exam. 
According to the FORWARD trial, prednisone 40 mg po for 5 days is 
noninferior to 14 day treatment with regard to reexacerbation within 6 months 
of follow up and significant reduced glucocorticoid exposure and decreased 
duration of hospital stay. 
- C/W breo elipta, singular albuterol prn 
#Chest pain
- She notes her left sided chest pain has occurred for 2 months and is 
intermittent. 
- It may be 2/2 to PNA, as per CXR noted left sided opacity with expiratory 
wheezing on exam or coronary vasospasm found on 9/2/22 since cath 7/2021 
showed nonobstructive CAD
- However, troponins were negative and EKG show no ischemic changes. 
- f/u troponins
- On exam, chest pain was reproducible with palpation, lidocaine patch can 
alleviate some pain

#AKI
- Cr 1.1 is elevated compared to 0.5 baseline several weeks ago. It may be 
pre-renal failure from volume loss while vomiting
- s/p 3.5L of fluids 
- follow up BUN/Cr and CMP 
#Mild AGMA with concomitant metabolic alkalosis
- AGMA may be due to ketosis due to minimal food intake, but lactate should 
be collected as well. 
- Metabolic alkalosis may be 2/2 to vomiting several times on Saturday night
#HTN
- Holding home hydrochlorothiazide and olmesartan
