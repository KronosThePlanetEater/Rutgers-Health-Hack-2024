HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr.  is a 48 y.o. male history of significant CAD (MI s/p PCI with stents 3/2016, stent 1/2019), 
HTN, DM who presents left arm pain.
Patient was in usual state of health until 2014-2016, when he developed left arm and shoulder 
pain. Initially believed to be due to meniscal tear, although persisted following treatment. 
Initial nuclear stress test was negative but CTA of coronaries showed 70% stenosis of mid LAD 
and found to have near complete occlusion during catheterization. He presented with similar 
left arm pain prior to his stent in 2019. After both procedures, his left arm pain resolved.
3 months ago (~5/2022), the patient started to develop left shoulder and arm pain, which 
would occur while lifting objects or driving. Patient notes restricting his activity (avoiding lifting 
or carrying heavy objects < 40 lbs) as it would trigger his symptoms, however, he was able to 
walk up to 25k steps daily without limitations. Patient did not have chest pain, shortness of 
breath, or jaw pain during these episodes. Patient was seen by his cardiologist in 6/2022 who 
recommended CTA. Due to scheduling and insurance issues, patient was only able to schedule 
imaging for 8/30/2022. 
Today, patient was using his electric bike in the woods when he suddenly developed extreme 
pain in left elbow radiating to hand. Patient also became extremely diaphoretic, developed 
shortness of breath and subsequently vomited "clear liquid". According to patient, he was 
short of breath for 1.5 hours (causing him to take 30 minutes to walk 50 yards) and was 
tachycardic to 150s for 1 hour. At the time, patient denied chest pain, heaviness, or jaw pain. 
Acute onset of symptoms this AM, which are different than his usual anginal symptoms, 
prompted him to be seen in ER.

EKG: nonspecific ST and T wave abnormalities. Sinus tachycardia.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Mr. K is a 48 y.o. male with history of significant CAD (MI s/p PCI with stents 3/2016, stent 
1/2019), HTN, DM who presents with symptoms and signs consistent with unstable angina. 
Submitted Thu 9/1 9:50 pm
#Unstable Angina
Given mild elevated troponins and non-specific ST elevations on EKG, patient presentation 
most consistent with NSTEMI (unstable angina). MI likely although no ST elevations noted on 
EKG.
- Plan for catheterization in tomorrow or Tuesday pending availability in cath lab with Dr. 
Hussain. 
 - Will order NPO tomorrow in preparation for cath lab. 
- Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a platelet P2Y12 receptor blocker is indicated in all 
patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACS).
 - s/p loading dose of Aspirin 325 mg. Continue Aspirin 81 mg QD.
- Continue Plavix 75 mg QD.
- Current literature suggests that incidence of acute coronary syndrome 
recurrence or death is lower prasugrel and ticagrelor than clopidogrel. If evidence of ACS on 
coronary angiogram, will consider transitioning from Clopidogrel to either Prasugrel or 
Ticagrelor upon discharge. If no evidence of ACS during coronary angiogram, may also consider 
staying on Clopidogrel as there would be no evidence of therapy failure and avoid cost of 
Ticagrelor and black box warnings of Prasugrel. 
- Anticoagulant therapy with unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, bivalirudin, or fondaparinux 
has been shown to prevent thrombus-related ischemic events in patients with NSTEMI. As 
patient is planned for early invasive therapy (cath lab tomorrow), UFH therapy is 
recommended. 
- Patient with suspected acute coronary syndrome should be risk stratified based on likelihood 
of ACS and adverse outcomes to determine need for hospitalization and guide treatment. Will 
proceed with HbA1c and lipid for risk stratification. 
- If chest pain recurs, will proceed with repeat troponins and EKG. 
- Echocardiography is recommended recommended to assess left ventricular and valvular 
function and exclude mechanical complications. Will proceed with TTE. 
#Diabetes Mellitus
Maintained on Semaglutide 6 mg QD. 
- Hold home medication and proceed with ISS. 
- Await HbA1c.
#HTN
- Continue Amlodipine 2.5 mg QD. Hold Candesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide 16-12.5 mg as per 
cardio rec.
#HLD
- Continue Atorvastatin 80 mg QD and Ezetimibe 10 mg QD.
#Reflux
- Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg QD.
Anxiety 
- Continue Alprazolam 0.5 mg QD.
#Osteoarthritis Knees
- Continue Tylenol prn.

 Overall objective of the study was to compare investigate the epidemiologic date of 
P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel vs prasugrel vs ticagrelor) and the association between 
therapy and its corresponding recurrence of acute coronary syndromes and/or death. 
 Patient population: adult patients (18 year-old or older) with diagnosis of acute 
coronary syndrome, including NSTEMI and STEMI. 
o My patient fits this criteria. 
 Intervention: Patients given prescription for either clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor. 
 Control: No true control, comparison between the 3 treatment regimens. 
 Outcomes: Following index ACS, incidence of ACS or death within 36 months. 
 Results: The cumulative incidence of acute coronary syndrome or death over 36 months 
was 23%, 10.6% and 13.7% in patients receiving clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor 
respectively. 
 Conclusion: The incidence of ACS or death in patients receiving is lower with prasugrel 
and ticagrelor than clopidogrel, therefore, the choice of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy impacts 
the risk of ACS recurrence or death. Given this patient’s prior history of previous ACS, 
risk factors (HLD, smoking, DM2) and strong family history, to consider transitioning 
from Clopidogrel to either Prasugrel or Ticagrelor upon discharge. Will need to also 
consider Prasugrel black box warnings (etc. stroke, TIA) and monthly cost of Ticagrelor 
($400+ per month supply on Good Rx). If no evidence of ACS during coronary 
angiogram, may also consider staying on Clopidogrel as there would be no evidence of 
therapy failure.
