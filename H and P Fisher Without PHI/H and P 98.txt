Chief Complaint:
Acute onset (~6 hours prior to arrival) of epigastric/right upper quadrant abdominal pain, 
radiation to back that began this morning at 8AM 
History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 yo male with PMH of T1DM on continuous insulin pump, HLD, HTN, ischemic 
cardiomyopathy (LVEF 40%), CKD 3, CAD s/p CABG (in 2016), and multiple ortho surgeries who
presents with an acute onset of epigastric abdominal pain, radiating to the back that began
morning at 8AM. Patient explains he is a former smoker where he quit 14 years ago (41 packyear) and a former alcohol drinker, quit around 15 years ago. He currently smokes marijuana 
daily. He has a complex medical and surgical history after multiple traumas from car and boat 
accidents. Within the past year he has not had any acute illnesses, other than most recently 
catching COVID last Thanksgiving. Of note, he describes he unintentionally lost 60 lbs during 
the past year due to decreased appetite, which the patient attributes it to feeling upset after his 
dog died last year.
Patient woke up this morning and followed his normal routine of drinking coffee and 
eating a teaspoon of honey. He also had a normal non-bloody, firm bowel movement this 
morning. While at rest, he suddenly started experiencing 10/10 epigastric/right upper quadrant 
abdominal and back pain which were not relieved with gabapentin, which he normally takes for 
joint pain after his ortho surgeries. Since the onset of his pain, it was constant and leaning 
forward slightly alleviated the pain. He describes the pain as an “in-between” of stabbing vs dull 
pain. Patient says this is the first time he has every experienced anything like this. He started to 
feel nauseous and vomited non-bilious, non-bloody clear phlegm. Of note, he unintentionally 
lost 60lbs for the past year due to decreased appetite, but he partially attributes this to feeling 
upset after his dog died last year. Otherwise, patient does not have any fevers, chills, 
diaphoresis, headaches, sore throat, rhinorrhea, dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, diarrhea, 
hematochezia, constipation, urinary urgency, dysuria, hematuria, changes in urine/stool color, 
or changes in skin color. Patient also did not recently travel, have exposure to sick contacts, 
change medications, and change diet.
At bedside, he was no longer complaining of any abdominal or back pain, and describes 
improved nausea after being given Zofran in the ED. He describes his symptoms improved after 
being in the ED and is currently only complaining of wanting to eat food.

Imaging:
CT Abdomen Pelvis With Contrast
Narrative: EXAM: CT ABDOMEN PELVIS W CONTRAST
CLINICAL INDICATION: Epigastric pain;
TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained. Sagittal and coronal 
reconstructions were performed. CT was performed using one or more dose reduction 
techniques including automated exposure control, adjustment of the mA and/or kV according 
to patient size, and/or use of iterative reconstruction technique.
IV Contrast: Intravenous contrast was administered.
Oral Contrast: Oral contrast was not administered.
COMPARISON: CT abdomen/pelvis 4/14/2013
Count of known CT scans and NM Myocardial Perfusion studies in last 12 months (Quality 
Measure G9321): None
FINDINGS:
Lung Bases: Scattered tree-in-bud opacities predominantly within the bilateral lower lobes, 
suspicious for bronchiolitis or aspiration.
Liver: Within normal limits. 
Biliary System: The common bile duct is dilated up to 15 mm, and contains multiple 
hyperdense filling defects including a focal 9 mm hyperdense structure, most likely 
representing choledocholithiasis (series 3, image 37). There is additional mural enhancement of 
the common bile duct wall, which may represent ascending cholangitis (series 3, image 36). 
Minimal central intrahepatic biliary dilation with pneumobilia (series 2, image 23 and series 3, 
images 22-30).
The gallbladder is distended and contains trace air (series 2, image 41). There are 
hyperattenuating structures are present within the gallbladder neck, consistent with 
cholelithiasis (series 2, images 31-32). No focal gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic 
free fluid.
Hepatic Vasculature: The hepatic veins and portal veins are patent.
Spleen: Within normal limits.


Pancreas: Atrophic pancreas.
Adrenal Glands: No focal mass lesion.
Kidneys, Ureters, and Bladder: Unchanged 2 cm left upper pole simple cyst. Unchanged 
scattered right renal hypodensities, statistically representing simple cyst. The urinary bladder is 
distended.
Lymph nodes: Within normal limits.
Aorta/Retroperitoneum: Status post CABG. Diffuse aortic atherosclerotic calcifications.
Bowel: Moderate colonic stool burden, suggestive of constipation. No focal bowel 
obstruction. Scattered linear hyperdensities are noted within the small bowel, likely 
representing prior ingested material. Appendix is not visualized.
Pelvic Organs: Within normal limits.
Abdominal/Pelvic Wall: Within normal limits.
Ascites: No evidence of ascites.
Bones: New heterogeneously appearing L4 vertebral body, containing a new focal lucent/lytic 
lesion with adjacent sclerosis, which is incompletely assessed on this examination. Chronic left 
L2 compression fracture. Surgical hardware in the bilateral proximal femurs.
Other Findings: Infrarenal inferior vena cava filter. There is atrophy of the left psoas major and 
iliacus muscles, likely secondary to altered biomechanics.
Impression: Findings most likely representing choledocholithiasis, with additional mural 
enhancement of the common bile duct wall possibly representing superimposed ascending 
cholangitis. Associated dilatation of the biliary tree. Cholelithiasis Pneumobilia and air within 
the gallbladder are of uncertain etiology, and may be secondary to gas-forming infection, 
recent intervention, incompetent sphincter of Oddi, or bowel/biliary fistula. Consider MRCP or 
ERCP for further evaluation.
Scattered tree-in-bud opacities within the bilateral lower lobes, suspicious for bronchiolitis or 
aspiration.
New L4 vertebral body lucent/lytic lesion, for which nonemergent MR lumbar spine without and 
with IV contrast should be performed for further evaluation.
Distended urinary bladder.
Moderate colonic stool burden, suggestive of constipation.
Unchanged bilateral renal cysts, for which no follow-up surveillance imaging is recommended 
based on appearance and temporality of stability.


Findings discussed with Julie Minnisch, PA-C and Dr. Katie Meyers via telephone at 2:15 PM on 
1/18/2023.
Lung followup should be guided by presumed infectious/inflammatory condition.

Assessment/Plan:
This is a 68 yo male with PMH of T1DM on continuous insulin pump, HTN, HLD, CKD 3, ischemic 
cardiomyopathy (LVEF 40%), CAD s/p CABG (2016) on aspirin, and multiple ortho surgeries who 
presents with an acute onset this morning of epigastric abdominal pain, radiating to back, 
associated with nausea and vomiting. In the ED, he was found to have transaminitis with no 
bilirubin elevation, no leukocytosis, and CT abdomen/pelvis revealing a likely 
choledocholithiasis, pneumobilia and possible ascending cholangitis. GI was consulted, s/p 


ERCP with stone removal, stent placement, and biopsy of gastric lesions, and now planning to 
consult surgery for preventive cholecystectomy evaluation. 
# Epigastric/RUQ Abdominal pain radiating to back
# Choledocholithiasis w/ possible ascending cholangitis
Given his presentation, differential diagnoses included choledocholithiasis, ascending 
cholangitis, malignancy, ulcers, and pancreatitis as possible causes of acute onset of epigastric 
abdominal pain. Choledocholithiasis is most consistent with the CT findings and ERCP although 
he has normal bilirubin levels. Ascending cholangitis is possible given the mural enhancement 
seen on CT, but he has no fever, localized RUQ pain, jaundice, AMS, or hypotension that are 
more consistent with the diagnosis. Although he unintentionally 60lbs of weight over the year, 
the negative imaging findings concerning for any malignant masses in the abdomen/pelvis area 
make any malignant masses (pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma) less likely etiologies for 
this acute pain. Given his lack of NSAID use in his history, gastric ulcer is also less likely. 
Although he has a history of alcohol drinking, the normal lipase level and imaging findings that 
are negative for any signs of pancreatitis make acute/chronic pancreatitis is not likely. 
- Epigastric/RUQ abdominal pain radiating to back
- No infectious symptoms (eg, fever), no leukocytosis, no jaundice, no elevated bilirubin
- Transaminitis but normal bilirubin and lipase, most likely acute stone obstruction that was 
caught quickly before infectious symptoms/bilirubin elevation occurred
- CT findings of dilated, 15mm CBD with focal 9mm hyperdense structure concerning for 
choledocholithiasis and mural enhancement of CBD concerning for cholangitis
- GI consulted by ED; now s/p ERCP with stone removal, stent placement, and biopsy of 
gastric lesions
- GI post-ERCP recs; consult surgery for preventive cholecystectomy eval
- Keep NPO
- Holding home aspirin post-procedure; check CBC before re-starting
# Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus
- Patient is on continuous glucometer and insulin pump at home, following Dr. Amarosa
- A1c 5mo ago 8.2, Glucose 269
- Endo consulted; they will see patient in AM
- Fingerstick blood glucose q6hours and continue with home insulin pump for now
# Extensive stool burden on CT
Although patient denied any symptoms of constipation, CT showed significant stool burden. 
- per GI, start on aggressive bowel regimen, miralax BID, Colace, Senna (consider uptitrating if 
no improvement)
# Unintentional weight loss
Patient unintentionally lost 60lbs during the past year due to reduced appetite, although he 
attributes it to being sad after he lost his dog. He has risk factors – former alcohol use, former
smoking history – that warrant him for CT screening for lung cancers and colon cancers. He 
reports his most recent colonoscopy was 18 years ago and does not recall ever undergoing a 
CT screen of his lungs.
- Outpatient follow-up for routine screening (CT lungs, colonoscopy)


# CKD 3, baseline GFR 30-59
- BUN 26, Cr 1.3, eGFR 59.8
- near baseline
