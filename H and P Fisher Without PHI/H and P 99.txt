Informant: Patient, Patient’s Husband
Reliability: Very good (patient is a nurse, patient’s husband is an EMT; both were well-aware of 
the patient’s prior medical history and current home medications)
Chief Complaint:
1 day of palpitations, chest pressure, nausea
History of Present Illness: 
This is a 49 yo female with PMH of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology (diagnosed 
6 years ago, EF < 35%), asthma, and pre-diabetes (A1c 5.7%) who presents with one day of 
palpitations, chest pressure, and nausea. Around 6 years ago, she started feeling short of breath, 
and was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy (EF 35%) that was presumed to be due to myocarditis. 
Her nuclear stress test in 2017 and most recent exercise stress test in 8/2022 were both negative 
for any signs of ischemia or scarring. She has been following up with an outpatient cardiologist 
in Morristown and was planned for a cardiac MRI in February 2023. Of note, since 2020, she 
caught COVID 4 times with the most recent infection three weeks prior to arrival. A month ago, 
she was also hospitalized for 4 days after having Influenza A. 
2 days ago, she missed her home medications – metoprolol, valsartan, spironolactone –
because she accidentally left them at work. Since yesterday evening, she started feeling chest 
pressure that did not radiate anywhere and palpitations when she was at rest in her bed. She 
describes this is the first time she ever felt this way. The palpitations were worse with lying down 
and she started feeling nauseous. When using her home pulse ox, it was ranging from 44 to 180, 
which prompted her to come to the ED. Prior to her arrival, she took 2 pills of 81mg aspirin and 
1 pill of metoprolol succinate 100mg. At bedside, she appears comfortable and currently does 
not complain of any chest pressure, nausea, palpitations, fever, chills, dyspnea, coughing, 
rhinorrhea, sore throat, vomiting, chest pain, dizziness, and abdominal pain. She also did not 
recently travel, have exposure to any sick contacts, and recent surgeries. 
ED Course: She was found to have new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, 
rates to 140s and 150s.

Assessment/Plan: 
This is a 49 yo female with PMH of HTN, presumed non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35%) 
diagnosed 6 years ago, asthma, and recent hospitalization for influenza who presents with 1 day 
of palpitations, nausea, and chest pressure. She was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid 
ventricular response, now rate controlled on metoprolol. Cardiology is following for further 
management, and possible cardioversion.
# New-onset Atrial fibrillation
- Unclear etiology (active infection vs thyrotoxicosis vs ischemic vs valvular/mechanical cardiac 
changes vs known cardiomyopathy). Patient has several risk factors (obesity, HTN, 
cardiomyopathy) that are correlated with new onset of atrial fibrillation.
- CHA2DS2VASC 3 (Female, HTN, CHF), started on heparin drip
H&P 5 Submitted Wednesday, 2023 02 01 7:00 pm
- afebrile, no leukocytosis, neg viral panel other than COVID+ on PCR (most likely due to 
recent, recovered COVID infection), negative CXR for infiltrates, active infectious etiology less 
likely
- TSH, free T4 normal, thyrotoxicosis unlikely
- troponin 10->7 negative x 2, EKG no signs of infarcts, ischemic etiology/ACS less likely
- valvular/mechanical causes, need to follow up TTE (most recent 8/2022 showed EF 30-35%, 
severe septal hypokinesis, moderate global hypokinesis, normal diastolic function)
- known cardiomyopathy, follow up TTE to see if there are any acute changes to EF; no signs 
of congestive heart failure (no JVD, edema, no signs of pulmonary congestion on CXR) make 
acute CHF exacerbation a less likely cause of atrial fibrillation 
- could have been triggered by previous infections (recent flu and COVID) 
- per cardio, fractionate metoprolol tartrate 25mg q6h, up-titrate to 200mg daily as tolerated 
(goal HR < 110); diltiazem contraindicated due to her reduced LVEF
- follow-up with cardiology, discuss antiarrhythmic vs cardioversion vs rate control
- NPO for possible cardioversion
- Risk stratification labs (TSH/T4 normal, follow-up on A1c, lipid panel)
- on tele
- outpatient ischemic eval
- outpatient cardiac MRI as scheduled
# Presumed non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (30-35% EF)
- GDMT: continue with fractionated home metoprolol, home spironolactone, home valsartan
- re-evaluate EF with f/u TTE
# Pre-diabetes, A1c 5.7% per patient, Glucose 125
- repeat A1c
- fingerstick glucose q6h while NPO
- insulin sliding scale
# Asthma
- continue with home albuterol, budesonide
# COVID-19 Positive
- patient is asymptomatic and most recent infection on first week of January; most likely 
positive PCR due to recent infection
- follow-up with infection control to clear isolation status
