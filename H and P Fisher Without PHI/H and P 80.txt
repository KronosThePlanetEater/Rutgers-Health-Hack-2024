CC: “My left hand and face went numb at work” this morning for half an hour
HPI:
A 68 y.o. male who presents with chief complaint of transient left-sided facial and arm weakness and 
numbness that lasted approximately 30 minutes this morning. His symptoms started at 8AM at work, 
with no exertion. He says he had two similar episodes affecting his hand in the past week but came in 
today because this time it affected his face as well. He explained that first his left hand and arm became 
numb and heavy but he had no pain. Then he felt his left face become numb to his mouth, describing his 
tongue feeling like it was injected with lidocaine. This was noticed by a coworker who called EMS. He 
had no loss of consciousness. Prior to a week before he has never had symptoms similar to this. He has a 
medical history pertinent for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and an MI requiring cardiac catheterization 
6 years ago. He has never smoked. 
In the ED, patient was hemodynamically stable besides a BP of 207/125. BP is now 183/106 without 
intervention. Noncontrast CT demonstrated no acute hemorrhage and CTA head and neck are currently 
pending. 
Currently, approximately 5 hours after symptom presentation, the patient has only a slight headache 
and his usual chronic back pain, however he has no fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, 
chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms. All other review of systems was negative.

Summary: 
In summary this a is a 68 year old gentlemen with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia, 
hypertension, and a MI presenting after his third episode of transient left arm and face numbness 
independent of exertion within the last week. His initial workup included a CT negative for intracerebral 
hemorrhage, CTA of the head and neck without obvious occlusion and an EKG with a right bundle 
branch and left axis deviation. 
A/P:
# Left arm and face numbness 
- The patient likely had a TIA, given the lack of findings on CT and CTA and no neurological deficit 
within the hospital. The description of his deficits at work sound to be focal, and he had no 
syncope. 
- An MRI would be able to distill if there was a small lacunar stroke, and is ordered. 
- Aspirin is being administered, 81 mg. He is prescribed this, but has not taken it consistently. 
- A transthoracic echocardiogram is ordered to evaluate for left atrial enlargement and clot 
formation. 
- A lipid panel is ordered to evaluate dyslipidemia. 
#HTN
- The patient has not been taking his blood pressure medications for a while. His blood pressure is 
currently 183/106. Target should be systolic 140. He will be given his lisinopril/hctz. It should be 
rechecked frequently, and if it continues to rise give IV labetalol or nifedipine. 
# Hyperlipidemia 
- The lipid panel as mentioned above is ordered 
- His home atorvastatin will be provided
# Rheumatoid Arthritis 
- Continue with Mobiq and Plaquenil 
# Cardiovascular disease 
- Troponins were normal when entering the ED 
# Care coordination 
- ED arrival and hospitalization has been sent to PCP

Appraise: 
The article comes from the National Stroke Research Institute of Australia and is in a peer reviewed 
journal. 
Advise: 
The article summarizes our current understanding of the relationship between hypertension and 
stroke/transient ischemic attack. Regarding demographics, approximately 58% of patients who have a 
stroke have diagnosed hypertension. 75% of patients who are later diagnosed with a stroke have a 
blood pressure of greater than 140 systolic when presenting to the emergency department. Our patient 
today had a blood pressure in excess of 180 systolic. 
Within the hypertensive population, 23% of patients who had a stroke had an earlier TIA. Half of these 
patients had the stroke within two days of the TIA. Our patient had two TIAs before presenting to the 
emergency department. To evaluate his risk for a stroke (as someone who has recently had a TIA), the 
ABCD scoring system can be used. 
He has a score of 5. A score greater than 4 puts him in the high risk category. It is suggested treatment 
within 24 hours of the first TIA would have been the most effective. Treatment consists of antiplatelet 
therapy, simvastatin, and blood pressure control (systolic < 140).
Interestingly the paper mentions that controlling diastolic blood pressure can have a drastic change on 
stroke risk. A 5-6 mmHg reduction in diastolic blood pressure can decrease stroke risk by approximately 
42%. However, the paper does not state within which population this is, and I am skeptical if a change 
from a diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 75 would have the same effect as a change from 125 to 120. 
An interesting aspect of this paper is the relationship between blood pressure cycles throughout the day 
and risk of stroke. Normally, people have a 10-20% decrease in blood pressure throughout the night as 
compared to daytime values. There is variation in this though and four categories are highlighted below. 

People with abnormal dipping patterns had increased risk of stroke. This was a 12% incidence of stroke 
for extreme dippers, 6.1% for dippers, 7.6% for nondippers, and 22% chance for reverse dippers. One 
study found that when comparing reverse dippers to everyone else, reverse dippers were at two times 
greater risk for stroke than all others. It is unknown what pattern our patient fell in, but he did have an 
abnormal sleep/wake cycle, as he woke up every day at 3 am. 
There is currently research into how different antiplatelet regimes can be adapted to account for diurnal 
blood pressure cycles.
