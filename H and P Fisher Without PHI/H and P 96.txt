History and Physical
Informant: Patient, Old records from cardiology office visits
Reliability: Good
Chief Complaint:
SOB (worse with exertion) and productive cough for 2 days
History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 95 yo female with PMH of chronic Afib on Pradaxa, HTN, hypothyroidism, breast 
cancer s/p mastectomy 1996 and lumpectomy 2005, and multi-valvular disease (moderatesevere AS, moderate MR, moderate-severe TR) s/p TAVR 2018 who presents with 2 days of 
SOB worse with exertion, associated productive cough, and nasal drip. For the past few 
years, her dyspnea has been progressively worsening with exertion (doing work around the 
house, cooking or laundry) but improves with rest. For the past 6 weeks, patient has been 
experiencing intermittent, mid-sternal chest tightness that worsens with exertion and 
improves with rest. For the past week, she noted decreased energy and loss of appetite. In
addition, she has been experiencing R ear pain and intermittent pressure that radiates 
around her ear. Yesterday, she started noticing a productive cough with clear phlegm and 
nasal drip, with increased dyspnea when coughing. She took 2 tablets of Dayquil yesterday 
with no significant improvement in her symptoms. This morning, she woke up with 
improved cough, but continued dyspnea with coughing. 
At bedside, patient continues to describe R ear pain but not currently experiencing any 
dyspnea, cough, chest tightness, or chest pain radiating to jaws or shoulders. She is not 
complaining of any fever, nausea, vomiting, chills, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, 
dysuria, changes in urinary frequency, and bone or muscle pain. Patient did not have any 
recent changes to her home medications, surgeries, travel, or exposure to sick contacts. Pt 
describes she did a COVID test at home yesterday and tested negative. Of note, patient has 
a family history of heart failure in her 3 sisters.

COMPARISON: 11/15/2017 chest x-ray
FINDINGS:
Lungs/Pleural Spaces: Faint bandlike opacity seen in the right upper lobe laterally is not well

are otherwise clear.
Cardiac silhouette: Moderate cardiomegaly. Mild central vascular congestion. The patient is 
post TAVR.

thoracic aorta.
Visualized bones: Upper thoracic kyphosis. 
Other: No other significant findings.
Impression: Cardiomegaly. Mild CHF.
A faint opacity is seen in the right upper lobe laterally but is bandlike appearance suggests 
either a rib related density or atelectatic or fibrotic change.

Diagnosis Date Noted
• Shortness of breath 01/06/2023
• Nonrheumatic tricuspid valve regurgitation 09/12/2022
Assessment/Plan:
Patient is a 95 yo female with PMH chronic Afib, HTN, hypothyroidism, and multi-valvular 
disease s/p TAVR 2018 presenting with few years of progressively worsening dyspnea, few 
months of intermittent angina, and URI-like symptoms for 2 days (productive cough, nasal 
drip, decreased appetite and energy) with associated dyspnea that is not improving upon 
rest.
# Dyspnea, Cough
Her onset of dyspnea could be 2/2 URI (given her productive cough, nasal drip, decreased 
energy and appetite) with underlying progressive coronary artery disease. Although she has
a proBNP of 2554, her CXR was unremarkable with mild CHF and physical exam was 
negative for crackles, edema, and other signs of fluid overload. Given her largely euvolemic 
status, acute exacerbation of CHF and concerns for acute coronary syndrome are less likely. 
In this acute setting, patient’s viral URI is most likely causing worsening dyspnea with 
coughing fits. 
- Respiratory viral panel for URI
- Not requiring supplemental oxygen currently
- Consult cardiology for ischemic eval (cath vs stress test?) since hx seems significant for 
angina
- Echo TTE to evaluate for heart failure
- telemetry monitoring
- continue with home meds 
#Aortic stenosis s/p TAVR, Tricuspid regurgitation
- Consult cardiology to consider right heart catheterization to assess hemodynamic status
- continue home med PO Lasix 20mg (no indication for increased diuresis since pt looks 
euvolemic on exam)
#? HF
Although patient looks euvolemic, patient’s chronic conditions, BNP elevation, and CXR 
showing mild CHF can be suggestive of HF. 
- Echo TTE to evaluate

# Hyponatremia
Based on her cardiologist's note, she is hyponatremic at baseline. Current presentation is 
also most likely due to decreased PO intake.
- Start on cardiac diet
- monitor with BMP
# R ear pain
This could be 2/2 URI given the onset. Since her physical exam was negative for any signs of 
infections, we can monitor the symptom.
#Leukocytosis
Elevated WBC of 2.87. Most likely 2/2 viral infection.
- Monitor with CBC
# HTN 
- continue with home med Ibersartan 75mg tablet daily
#Hypothyroidism
- continue with home med Levothyroxine 75mg tablet daily
#Chronic Afib
- continue with home med Pradaxa 75mg capsule bid
- continue with home med Diltiazem (Cardizem) 24hr ER 1.20mg capsule daily
#Fe def anemia
- continue with home med Ferrous sulfate 325mg (65mg Fe) tablet every other day
#Distant hx of breast cancer
Stable. Pt has been getting her yearly follow-up mammography screening. 
FENP: none | replete PRN | cardiac diet | pradaxa


The viral panel came back after this H&P was written, and she tested positive for COVID-19.

Can early Remdesivir prevent progression to severe COVID-19 in patients?
Gottlieb RL, Vaca CE, Paredes R, et al. Early Remdesivir to Prevent Progression to Severe 
Covid-19 in Outpatients. N Engl J Med. 2022;386(4):305-315. 
doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2116846
P: Patients with Covid-19 who had symptom onset within previous 7 days and ≥1 risk 
factor for disease progression (age ≥ 60 yo, obesity, certain coexisting medical 
conditions) in outpatient setting
I: IV remdesivir (200mg on day 1, 100mg on days 2 and 3)
C: Placebo. No Remdesivir intervention.
O: Composite of hospitalization for any cause or death from any cause by day 14
Overall, the trial showed that patients who received 3 days of remdesivir had 87% lower 
risk of Covid-19-related hospitalizations or death. There are also other data from 
different trials that earlier intervention with remdesivir has a greater efficacy the course 
of Covid-19 infection. However, the main limitations of this trial are that there were 
under-representation of Black/Asian race, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, 
immunocompromised status, and cancer patients. In addition, this trial (like other Covid19 related trials) excluded patients who received the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Our patient 
was vaccinated and admitted to our hospital, so a few factors don’t correspond to the 
methods used when selecting patients in this study. Patient was given remdesivir once 
we found out she was positive for COVID-19 because of her risk factors for disease 
progression – age of 95 years and coexisting medical conditions. She is currently only 
presenting with mild cough, but otherwise doing well with no need for supportive 
oxygen or corticosteroids.
