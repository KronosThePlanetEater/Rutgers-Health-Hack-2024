PRINCIPAL PROBLEM:
Painful, necrotic and non-healing wound in anterior right lower leg that she noticed 1 week
ago. 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
“Poorly healing wound”
 
Subjective
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
____ is a 61 y.o. female with PMH HTN, non-insulin dependent DM-2, Obesity, previous history
of bilateral DVTs with residual chronic bilateral lower extremity edema, generalized pain
disorder secondary to MVA (currently on methadone 80 mg po) who presents with a 3x3 cm
circular necrotic non-healing open wound on the RLE draining foul smelling purulent discharge.
She reports that she bumped her right leg into a table approximately one month prior to
admission, at which time she states that she felt immediate significant pain and experienced
swelling in the area which eventually subsided within the day to resemble a large “blood
blister.” At the time, she was able to bear weight and states that over the following few weeks
from initial trauma, the wound started to flatten and turn black and blue. Approximately one
week prior to admission, she states that the wound began crusting and turning black while
becoming more painful and in the last few days began draining foul smelling purulent discharge
with progressive pain. Upon admission, she rates the pain a 6/10 and describes it as dull with no
radiation to the right thigh, calf or foot. She reports the pain is now present at rest and
worsened with walking, recently to the point that it interferes ambulating around the house.
She reports this is the first time she has had a non-healing wound and does not report recent
fever or chills.
Upon arrival to ED, patient was afebrile, T of 97.7F, RR of 18, SpO2 98% on room air with HR of
95, WBC of 16.39 and received Vancomycin 1000mg IV and Zosyn 4.5g IV for RLE wound and
Tdap booster IM. Additionally, she had episodes of hypertension with systolics ranging in 200s
and diastolics ranging 90s that was successfully managed with Hydralazine 10mg IV and
amlodipine 5mg PO, with systolics coming down into the 170s and diastolics coming down into
the 70s.
Upon my evaluation in the ED, patient notes she notes that she is feeling better and reports
subjective improvement of her wound since receiving antibiotics. Pt reports redness, pain,
increased swelling, and foul-smelling purulent discharge all of which have significantly improved
compared to prior, but she does not report malaise, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea,
vomiting, or increased confusion. Pt does not report loss of sensation in the area of her RLE

report fatigue, changes in appetite or weight loss. Additionally, she notes that she has not been
compliant with Metformin 1000 mg BID not following up with Medemerge clinic and notes she
does not have a PCP because she is stressed with work and caring for her family.

IMAGING, AND OTHER STUDIES:
10/4/22
U/S venous duplex B/L LEs: No signs of DVT in right or left leg.
U/S arterial segment pressure: ABI in right leg is 1.06 and left leg is 1.05 which suggests minimal
ischemia. Pressure gradient is less than 10 mmHg bilaterally.
 
XR of Right tibia/fibula: Signs of soft tissue swelling. No signs of subcutaneous gas or foreign 
bodies. 
 
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Patient is a 61 y.o female with PMH of HTN, non-insulin dependent DM-2, COPD who presents
with chronic RLE non healing wound after trauma with history of poor medical compliance due
to complicated social history who also presents with hypertensive urgency with BP 211/86 with
no signs of end organ damage.
Submitted Wed 2022 10 05 ~8:00 pm
# RLE non healing open wound- possibly secondary to cellulitis and +/- osteomyelitis
-Physical exam shows signs of infection including erythema, tenderness and warmth to touch,
with signs of necrosis in the 3x3cm open nonhealing wound with foul smelling white-yellow
discharge supporting dx cellulitis
-On exam was able to probe right tibia, osteomyelitis should be ruled out by MRI of RLE.
- Continue vancomycin 1000mg IV given concern for MRSA and likely etiology stemming from
Group A Strep or Staph Aureus until deep wound culture, peripheral blood culture return with
sensitivities
-Given hx of non-insulin dependent DM-2, recommend coverage for pseudomonas via
continued use of Zosyn IV.
- Gen surgery should be consulted for possible debridement to prevent progression into bone.
- Given extended course of healing, wound care should be consulted
- History of non-insulin dependent DM-2 and noncompliance with metformin and current
smoker worried for peripheral vascular disease but ABI RLE 1.06 and LLE 1.05, with pressure
gradient less than 10 mmHg bilaterally, and 2+ DP PT pulses equal all suggest intact perfusion.
#Hypertensive urgency
- Initial BP 211/86, noncompliant with medications
-There are no signs of end organ damage but in ED she was given IV Hydralazine 10 mg,
amlodipine 5 mg and responded with BP now down to 170/70s.
-Recommend pt resume amlodipine 5 mg PO QD, and now lisinopril 10 mg PO QD to decrease B
-Given history of COPD, plan to educate pt on side effect of cough associated with linopril 
#Leukocytosis
- WBC 16.39, CRP 1.02
-pt does not meet SIRS criteria, however given extent of infection continue to trend WBC and
vitals
#Non-insulin depdendent DM-2
- Hold Metformin 1000 mg BID.
- SSI with meals
- follow up on Hemoglobin A1C and Lipid profile
-pending lab results, plan to initiate outpatient workup for diabetes management as her poorly
controlled diabetes may have contributed to her poor wound healing
#Chronic COPD
-Poorly compliant with medications, not currently being followed by physician, notes some
occasional SOB with exertion
- DuoNebs in ED successful, no signs of wheezing or use of accessory muscles so likely not in
acute exacerbation of COPD.
- Noncompliant with albuterol at home. Continue duonebs prn
#Obesity
-BMI>25
-recommend calorie restricted diet
-recommend increased exercise regimen
Submitted Wed 2022 10 05 ~8:00 pm
#Opoid use disorder
- Spoke with Organization for Recovery Inc, methadone clinic who confirmed methadone
dosing
-Continue pt on methadone 80mg PO QD
#Tobacco use
-Given significant smoking history, recommend pt be placed on nicotine patch
-begin with 14mg patch, increase to 21mg if inadequate
-plan to educate pt on recommendations for smoking cessation
- C/w nicotine patch 14mg
