Chief Complaint:
1-week of flu-like symptoms (fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, coughing, dyspnea, palpitations, 
sweats, rhinorrhea, sore throat, myalgia)
History of Present Illness: 
This is a 63 y.o. male with PMH of HIV diagnosed in 1995 on antiretroviral therapy, treated hepatitis C, 
polysubstance use disorder, IV drug use, and depression who presents to ED from home after EMS being 
called for depressive thoughts. Per EMS, he was found to be febrile 101.4F, tachycardic, and hypoxic in 80s. 
One week prior to arrival, he started experiencing flu-like symptoms of fever, nonbloody/yellow/productive cough, night sweats, rhinorrhea, sore throat, nausea, non-bloody vomiting, 
non-bloody diarrhea, headaches, abdominal pain, and myalgia. He describes decreased oral intake and 
sleeplessness associated with these symptoms. Of note, his girlfriend is also ill with flu-like symptoms, but 
patient is unsure who became sick first. He did not recently travel or undergo any recent procedures or 
surgeries. He did not receive flu or COVID vaccines. 
At bedside in the ED, he continues to describe fatigue, myalgia, productive coughing, and sore throat. He 
did not complain of any nausea, tremors, pain or discharge in his eyes or ears, dysuria, burning sensation 
while urinating, and polyuria. He also did not express any depressive thoughts, anxiety, suicidal/homicidal 
ideation, and auditory/visual hallucinations. When asked about his last alcohol intake, he provided 
inconsistent history to ED vs our team, expressing he did not have alcohol for the past 3-4 months vs 1 
week. He does not recall ever having any seizures, being hospitalized, or intubated for alcohol withdrawal. 
He told the ED that he last used heroin this morning through snorting, but no recent IV drug use. 
Per patient, he has been taking his HIV medications (Truvada, Tivicay) regularly since diagnosis in 1995, 
but he has not seen his primary care provider since last year. Per chart, his most recent CD4 absolute 
count was 521 in 3/2022 and negative for HIV viral load in 6/2022. 
ED Course: 1.7L NS Bolus, started on empiric azithromycin 500mg, ceftriaxone 1g, given acetaminophen 
1000mg IV, on 1:1, started on 2L NC

Assessment/Plan: 
This is a 63 y.o. male with PMH of HIV on antiretroviral therapy, treated hepatitis C, polysubstance use 
disorder, IV drug use, and depression who initially presented to EMS with a fever of 101.4F, tachycardia, 
and hypoxia in 80s. In the ED, he describes 1 week of flu-like symptoms, and was found to be positive for 
Influenza A with elevated procalcitonin 0.633, no leukocytosis, CXR with mild perihilar markings and 
negative for pneumonia/lung consolidations. Patient is now afebrile after Tylenol and breathing 
comfortably on room air. 
#Influenza A Positive
- flu-like symptoms are consistent with viral panel positive for Influenza A
- now afebrile after Acetaminophen
- initially put on 2L NC -> back to room air, breathing comfortably
- CXR negative for any consolidations or concern for pneumonia; mild perihilar markings
- normal lactate (2.10 -> 1.00), unlikely sepsis
- procalc 0.633 elevated, no leukocytosis
- empirically given ceftriaxone (1/26), azithromycin (1/26) x 1 in the ED
- hold antibiotics for now, follow-up with 2-view CXR 
- follow-up on blood culture, respiratory/sputum culture

- most likely secondary to decreased PO intake for 1 week
- s/p repletion with 1.7L NS bolus
- follow-up BMP tonight, replete PRN 
#Abnormal Urinalysis
- 1+ ketone, 2+ blood, 1 RBC, 2+ protein, 2.0 urobilinogen
- 1+ ketone most likely secondary to starvation, decreased PO intake
- 2+ blood, 1 RBC concerning for rhabdomyolysis, follow-up creatine kinase, CK-MB tonight 
#Polysubstance use
- history of ETOH use, IVDU, polysubstance use
- Utox positive for cocaine, opiates
- peer recovery consulted
- COWS to monitor for opiate withdrawal – Loperamide, Zofran, Ativan PRN
- if hemodynamically unstable or symptoms concerning for alcohol withdrawal, consider CIWA protocol 
(given his history of ETOH disorder)
#?Depressive thoughts
- Patient currently does not express any concerns for depression, anxiety, AVH, SI/HI. Patient believes 
there was a misunderstanding with the Ems.
- continue with 1:1 for tonight
