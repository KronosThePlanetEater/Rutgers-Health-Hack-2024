Reason For Study: Mitral regurgitation, determine severity, prior echo
Procedures: A 2D transesophageal echocardiogram with Doppler and color flow
Doppler was performed. IV sedation administered by the anesthesia department,
refer to the anesthesia record. The study was technically adequate. Informed
consent for Transesophageal Echocardiogram, and use of a contrast agent as
needed, was obtained prior to the procedure. The patient was brought to the
cath lab in a fasting state. An intravenous line was placed. A topical
anesthetic agent was used for oropharangeal anesthesia. A bite block was
inserted. A multifrequency, multiplane transesopheageal echocardiographic
endoscope was inserted and manipulated in the standard fashion to achieve
multiplane views. The transesophageal probe was passed without difficulty. The
patient tolerated the procedure well without evidence of orophangeal or
esophageal trauma. Complications: None. The study was done portable in the
Cath Lab.

Interpretation Summary
The left ventricle is dilated
The left ventricular ejection fraction is normal.
The mitral valve is status post repair with an annuloplasty ring and chordal
repair/replacement
There is severe mitral regurgitation. The primary etiology is degenerative
mitral valve disease manifested by severe mitral prolapse and a flail gap
Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is dilated. There is mild concentric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular ejection fraction is normal.
Right Ventricle: The right ventricle is moderately dilated. The right
ventricular systolic function is normal.
Atria, left and right: The left atrial size is normal. No thrombus is detected
in the left atrial appendage. No left atrial mass or thrombus visualized.
Right atrial size is normal.
Aortic Valve: The aortic valve is trileaflet. There is no aortic stenosis.
Trace (trivial) aortic regurgitation.
Mitral Valve: There is moderate mitral valve thickening. The annulus is
dilated. A portion of the posterior leaflet appears tethered. There is a
synthetic chord and/or repaired chord attached to the anterior leaflet. There
is bileaflet prolapse which is most severely affecting the medial portions of
the leaflets, more so the anterior leaflet, causing a flail gap between the
posterior leaflet measuring up to at least 1.0 cm in the greatest visualized
dimension.This results in a highly eccentric mitral regurgitant jet which is
intitially posteriorly directed but then flows around a portion of the
prosthetic ring and/or left atrium such that jets final direction is directed
anteriorly. There is severe mitral regurgitation. The mitral regurgitant jet
is eccentrically directed. There is blunting of systolic flow in the right
pulmonary veins. An annuloplasty ring is noted in the mitral position. The
ring is a partial ring.
Tricuspid Valve: There is mild tricuspid valve thickening. There is trace
tricuspid regurgitation. There was insufficient TR detected to calculate RV
systolic pressure.
Pulmonic Valve: Structurally normal pulmonic valve. Trace pulmonic valvular
regurgitation.
Arteries: The aortic root is normal size. Mild atherosclerotic plaque(s) in
the aortic arch.

Assesment and Plan
In summary, patient is a 69 y.o M with PMH of paroxysmal Afib, Left sided CHF, chronic anemia, 
mitral regurgitation s/p MVR in 2012 and prostate cancer s/p resection who initially presented 
with syncopal episode, likely cardiogenic due to Aflutter with rapid ventricular response, 
currently admitted for rate and rhythm control. 
#Syncope
- Likely from Aflutter with conversion pause. Ischemia to brain could cause temporary syncope 
but he did not have focal neurologic deficits and CT ruled out ischemia or hemorrhage.
- He lacks risk factors for stroke like smoking, DM-2, CAD but does have hypertension and is 
currently on at home eliquis.
- There are aneurysms in right mca and right cavernous ICA but are small with no signs of 
hemorrhage. MRI should be ordered. He did not show any signs of slurred speech, vision 
changes or decreased muscle strength on exam.
#A flutter with RVR and Parosyxmal Afib
- Patient is currently tachycardic at 130s and shows flutter waves in last ekg. It is important to 
control rate with beta blockers like metoprolol. If he continues to be tachycardic may increase 
metoprolol from 15 mg po to 25 mg po or 50 mg po. 
- Catheter ablation in the right atrium along the tricuspid annulus would be the gold standard for 
Aflutter but would not fully alleviate his Afib.
- His damaged mitral valve is most likely the cause of afib by pooling blood in the left atrium and 
causing a rapid ventricular response. 
- IV Amiodarone may be used for rhythm control since it has less toxic pulmonary effects than 
oral but still should be used acutely because of many toxic effects including blue-gray 
discoloration in skin, optic neuritis and prolonged QT interval.
- Repeat ECG and Telemetry is warranted. 
- Digoxin could provide benefit by decreasing AV node conduction and provides benefits with 
patients with heart failure by increasing intracellular ca+ to increase myocardiac contractility. 
Side effects include hypokalemia and acute renal failure so repeat CMP should be ordered every 
day. 
- Hypokalemia would show flattened or inverted T waves on EKG. 
#Mitral Regurgitation s/p MVR in 20212
- TEE: showed EF of 40-45%, a little below normal with dilated LV and normal LVED with severe 
MR and flail leaflet. 
- This could be causing CHF but he denied cough, orthopnea, lower extremity swelling and on 
exam pulmonary sounds were CTA with no LE edema. 
- He should c/w furosemide 20 mg po. 
 
#HTN: c/w amlodipine 5mg once at home. For now, increased metoprolol would decrease BP
#Anemia: He currently takes ferrous sulfate 65 mg po. Hgb is 10.6 and MCV is 86.2. 
#Aneurysms- small and were noted as incidental. Should follow up with neuro outpatient. 
H&P 2 Submitted Wed 2022 09 21 9:30 pm
#Prostate cancer
- s/p resection, will follow up on the year of the procedure and if took chemotherapeutics.
