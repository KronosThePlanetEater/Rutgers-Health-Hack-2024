Chief Complaint:
Alcohol Withdrawal for 3 days, Auditory/Visual hallucinations
History of Present Illness:
This is a 46 y.o. male with a PMH of EtOH use disorder, Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic 
features, and T2DM who presents with auditory/visual hallucinations and concerns for alcohol 
withdrawal after not drinking 3 days ago. Pt has been drinking since he was 14yo and has had 
frequent ED visits for either alcohol intoxication (normally drinking about 10 beer cans daily) or 
alcohol withdrawal. He has a history of voluntary inpatient psychiatric hospitalization in July 2020 
due to MDD with severe psychosis. Per collateral from patient’s sister, patient has been to alcohol 
rehabs several times, with the most recent stay last year. Per chart review, he had stated that he 
had 1 episode of unwitnessed seizure in the setting of alcohol binging in January 2022. Pt’s sister
describes that patient has been evicted from apartments several times due to drinking problems 
and was brought to the sister’s residence a few days ago. However, once he came to his sister’s 
residence, he promised to stop drinking and last drank 3 days ago prior to arrival. On the first day 
of not drinking, he reports he was nauseous, vomited, and had abdominal pain that improved. On 
the second day of not drinking, patient’s sister reports that patient was describing he saw and 
heard people in his sister’s house upstairs when there was no one at home. Today prior to arrival, 
patient’s sister witnessed the patient running towards a house that he described was “burning,” 
but the house was not burning.
At bedside, patient appears disheveled and remains tangential when asking questions. He does 
not complain of any fever, nausea, vomiting, headaches, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain,
auditory/visual hallucinations, tactile hallucinations, and SI/HI.

Assessment/Plan:
This is a 46 y.o. male with a PMH of EtOH use disorder, MDD with psychotic features, and T2DM 
who presents with auditory, visual hallucinations and alcohol withdrawal concerning for alcoholic 


hallucinosis vs psychosis.
# Alcohol Withdrawal
- hx of drinking since age 14, multiple rehabs and ED visits
- last drink 3 days prior to arrival
- CIWA protocol 
- Zofran PRN for nausea
- MVI, folate, thiamine
- tele monitoring
- peer recovery consulted
#Hallucinations
#MDD with psychotic features
Hallucinations are concerning for alcoholic hallucinosis vs psychosis (given patient’s hx of MDD 
with features of psychosis and previous voluntary psych hospitalization in 7/2020 where he was 
rx’ed Risperdal 1mg PO at bedtime, Prozac 30mg PO daily which he does not take right now). 
- CIWA as above
- UDS
- consult psych tomorrow AM
# Elevated LFTs, Thrombocytopenia
ALT 51, AST 79, total bili 1.9. Mildly elevated LFTs which were normal during previous ED visits. 
Most likely 2/2 alcohol use. 
- RUQ U/S to rule out cirrhosis
#Thrombocytopenia
Plt 111 on admission, previously 200s on previous visits. Most likely 2/2 liver disease.
- Follow-up HIV, HCV
# Anion gap Metabolic acidosis
AG 18, most likely 2/2 alcoholic ketoacidosis vs starvation ketosis d/t poor PO intake. Lactate was 
1.10 wnl, ruled out lactic acidosis.
- continue to monitor BMP
- U/A for ketones
- ? VBG if needed for further exploration of metabolic acidosis
# Normocytic Anemia
Hb 12.2, MCV wnl. Most likely 2/2 alcohol use.
- F/u iron studies, vit B12, folate
# T2DM (not on home meds)
HbA1c 6.6 on ED visit 2/2022. Was rx'ed metformin 500mg bid during that admission, but he is no 
longer taking any medications. Glucose 167 today on admission.
