
History obtained from patient in the presence of his spouse appears to be reliable
CC: Lower extremity weakness x 12 hours
HPI: Patient is a 70y y/o male with no significant PMHx presents for sudden lower extremity
weakness that began at approximately 8pm last night. Yesterday, he had a completely normal
day for him, walked approximately 4 miles with his partner in Philadelphia with no difficulty. He
returned home around 7pm and watched a movie in bed. As he got up to go to the bathroom,
he felt weakness and required his partners assistance to walk to the bathroom. The next few
times he went to the bathroom throughout the night, he required ambulatory assistance as
well. No falls during this period. In the morning, he was still feeling weak, although it was
slightly improved and decided to come to the ED. He has had no sensory deficits in his lower
extremities or bowel or bladder incontinence. He also reports that he has had an ulcer on his
back for the past 6 years which he can feel is getting larger by feeling the margins but has never
looked at it himself. He has not allowed his partner to view it and has never been evaluated for
it by a physician. It is not painful and has not affected his ADLs, although he has been wearing a
towel in his pants as there has been occasional drainage which he noticed has increased
recently. The patient has a history of recurrent sun burns and blisters while in Australia where
he lived until 20 years PTA. He also reports 20lb weight loss in the past year which was not
intentional with no changes in diet/exercise. He had a colonoscopy 5 years PTA which was
normal, but has had no other medical visits or lab work for the past 10 years. No recent
infections. Reports no fevers, chills, fatigue, headache, lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain,
palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/D, constipation, rashes, edema, upper extremity motor
weakness, or joint pain.

Imaging:
03/01/2022 CT Lumbar Spine W/O ContrastLarge decubitus ulcer involving the mid to lower lumbar spine and overlying the right upper
sacrum with associated destructive changes and osteomyelitis involving at least the the spinous
process and left lamina at L3 and the L4 spinous process. MRI of the lumbar spine performed
with and without intravenous gadolinium is recommended to evaluate for the possibility of
epidural abscess.
Foci of gas within the epidural and/or subdural spaces within the spinal canal likely related to
direct communication with the large decubitus ulcer.
Moderate chronic appearing anterior wedge compression fracture along the superior endplate
of T11.

EKG:
Assessment and Plan:
70y y/o m w/ no PMHx who presents for sudden lower extremity weakness x 1 day. Found to
have a 20/30cm lesion on the back with involvement to the bone which has been progressing
for 6 years in the setting of previous excessive sun exposure and 20lbs weight loss in the past
year. CT lumbar spine showed large decubitus ulcer involving the mid to lower lumbar spine
and overlying the right upper sacrum with associated destructive changes and osteomyelitis
involving at least the spinous process and left lamina at L3 and the L4 spinous process. Foci of
gas within the epidural and/or subdural spaces within the spinal canal likely related to direct
communication with the large decubitus ulcer. Significant hematuria, neutrophil predominant
leukocytosis, and anemia. Concerning for cutaneous malignancy with invasion into spine versus
infectious etiology, possibly both. Long standing growth and history concerning for malignancy
SCC vs Basal cell. New onset weakness with imaging showing invasion into spine concerning but
exam not consistent with signs of spinal compression. Malignancy is associated with
leukocytosis/anemia and could explain hematuria with renal involvement. Autoimmune process
possible, skin ulcers and renal involvement.
