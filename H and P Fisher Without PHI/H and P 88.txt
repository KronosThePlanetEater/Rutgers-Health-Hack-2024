CHIEF COMPLAINT:
 “I have a severe headache and bright lights hurt my eyes for 5 days” 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
NP is a 50 y.o. female with a PMH of HTN, CKD stage 1 and recent gastric sleeve placement
(September 2022) who presented to the ED on Wednesday (10/10/2022) with severe 10/10 
headache localized to frontal and both temporal regions that is pounding and band like with 
associated fever, chills, N/V/D, photophobia and neck tenderness. She reports that she was in 
her usual state of health, until 6 days before admission, she first noticed a moderate headache 
with right sided neck pain that was constant throughout the day and did not improve with 
Tylenol. Five days before admission, she awoke with a severe headache, subjective fever, chills, 
N/V and 2 episodes of watery diarrhea with associated photophobia and neck tenderness that 
continued and prompted her to come to the ED on Monday (10/8/2022). During this ER visit, 
she presented with persistent severe headache, photophobia and neck tenderness and was 
tested for COVID and Influenza which were negative. She was discharged with "viral illness". Her 
symptoms persisted, and she decided to come into the ED last night (10/10/2022). She does 
mention that before symptom onset, she visited large family gatherings including a funeral and 
a wake for a death in the family but does not report sick contacts or travel out of the country.
Upon visit to the ED, her temperature was 102.6, HR 90 and the rest of her vitals WNL. CT head
w/o contrast was performed and showed no signs of acute hemorrhage or infarct. In the ED, 
multiple LPs were attempted but could not succeed because patient kept moving due to pain 
and body habitus made conditions difficult. She was started with IV Ceftriaxone and IV 
Vancomycin, IV Ofirmev and IV Reglon. 
Upon my visit today, she reports continued bifrontal headache that is 9/10 after Tylenol with 
continued photophobia and neck tenderness with active flexion. She reports fatigue, fever, 
chills with nausea and 1 episode of watery diarrhea overnight. She does not report any recent 
falls or trauma to head. She does not report family history of aneurysm or subarachnoid 
hemorrhage but notes her younger daughter was recently diagnose with migraines. She does 
not report since onset of symptoms, focal weakness in extremities or changes in speech or 
vision.

Assesment and Plan:
Summary Statement: XXXXXXXXX is a 50 y.o. female with a PMH of HTN and recent gastric 
sleeve in 9/2022 who presents with 5 day history of worsening pounding bifrontal headache, 
cervical pain, photophobia, NVD, fever, chills and lethargy.
Submitted Wed2022 10 19 9:00 pm
#Severe Headache and cervical tenderness
Her severe 10/10 headache and cervical pain and photophobia with associated NVD causes 
concern for meningitis. It is difficult to discern whether viral or bacterial meningitis. However, 
she first presented with sore throat and headache that transitioned to nausea and vomiting with 
multiple episodes of watery diarrhea make enterovirus likely. 
Bacterial meningitis is still likely based on sore throat, fever, chills but WBC count was normal 
upon first presentation. Also on the differential is subarachnoid hemorrhage because of the 
severe headache with N/V and photophobia which she describes as worst in her life, however CT 
head w/o contrast ruled out any infarction or hemorrhage. 
Migraine is on the differential since family history of migraine in her younger daughter, 
headache seems disabling and has interfered with her daily life. Also, the duration of headache 
is for more than 3 days with nausea, photophobia but denied visual or auditory aura. Abortive 
treatment would be NSAID, triptans or dihydroergotamine and prophylaxis with improved sleep 
habits, exercise, diet and beta blockers or anticonvulsants. 
Plan:
- LP and CSF analysis will help determine which type of meningitis. Viral meningitis would show 
normal or increased opening pressure, no organisms on gram stain, lymphocyte predominance 
and normal glucose vs low glucose and neutrophil predominance in bacterial meningitis. The LP 
can also rule out xanthochromia from subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
- Peripheral blood cultures were sent as soon as she presented to rule out bacterial meningitis
- If concern for bacterial meningitis, add adjuvant dexamethasone.
- PCR for HSV for possible encephalitis could be ordered but patient's presentation without AMS 
or focal neurologic deficits make herpes simplex virus unlikely. 
- If CSF fluid shows gram positive organisms, treatment with Ampicillin for Listeria could be 
started.
#Hypokalemia:
She is most likely hypokalemic because of poor po intake throughout the last week and recent 
bariatric surgery in September. 
- Plan to repeat CMP and monitor EKGs. EKG on 10/12 showed NSR with no arrythmias.
2.6 on presentation, likely 2/2 recent h/o of N/V and poor PO intake in the s/o recent bariatric 
surgery
- Monitor BMP, replete PRN
Chronic conditions:
#HTN: Continue home betaxolol 10mg daily
#Depression: Continue home zoloft 50mg daily
#Arrythmia: Frequent PVCs controlled with BB
#h/o Bariatric surgery: Continue home D3, B12, iron, and multivitamin supplementation
FENP: None / Replete PRN / Regular diet / Lovenox
