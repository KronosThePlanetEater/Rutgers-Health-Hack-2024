Mr. Z is a 34 y.o. male with history of Hepatis C (untreated), GERD, depression and anxiety who 
was presents following a dog bite yesterday morning. Patient was attempting to grab 
his Siberian Husky but was inadvertently bitten on his right index finger. Patient 
suffered multiple puncture sites along palmar and dorsal aspect of the right index finger and 
nail bed. Immediately following the injury, patient cleaned the lesion with hydrogen peroxide 
then bandaged his hand and went to work. As the day progressed, the lesion became 
progressively painful, swollen, hot, and developed purulent drainage. Patient repeatedly 
cleaned the lesions, applied Neosporin, ice, warm compresses, and took Aleve without 
improvement. Symptoms continued to progress throughout the night into the morning which 
prompted him to be seen in Somerset ER. Patient was treated with Ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV, 
Clindamycin 600 mg IV, Zofran, Morphine and subsequently transferred to RWJ for plastic 
surgery evaluation.

on Dilaudid for pain.

twinges along right index finger, graded 9/10. Patient also reports associated right index finger 
weakness, which attributes to pain and swelling, decreased sensation, and numbness 
and tingling. Patient initially noticed pallor of his finger, which he attributed to tight bandaging 
of hand, but has since resolved.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Mr. Z is a 34 y.o. male with history of Hepatitis C (untreated), anxiety, depression, GERD who 
presents to the ED with right 2nd digit tenderness, erythema, edema and purulent drainage 
with associated weakness and decreased sensation following dog bite 1 day ago.
#Right Index Finger Wound 2/2 Dog Bite
Patient is afebrile. Labs significant for leukocytosis. X-rays notable for right 2nd finger tissue 
swelling. Patient presentation most concerning for tenosynovitis of right 2nd finger. Less 
likely right 2nd digit abscess as patient does not note fluctuance and x-ray negative for soft 
tissue fluid collection. Less likely necrotizing soft tissue infection as no soft tissue air noted on 
x-ray. 
- Followed by plastics. Recommendations are as follows; 
Submitted Thu 8/25/2022 7:00 am
 - Maintain on volar splint and cartar pillow until OR tomorrow.
 - Plan for incision and washout of right IF flexor tendon sheath tomorrow. NPO at 
midnight.
 - Proceed with betadine soaks TID. 
- s/p Ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV and Clindamycin 600 mg IV in Somerset ER. ID consulted for 
antibiotic management given history of amoxicillin allergy. ID recommendations: 
 - Proceed with Ceftriaxone 2g Q24H and Flagyl 500 mg 8H. 
 - Recommend wound culture during surgery to narrow antibiotic treatment thereafter.
 - Await ID recommendations for tetanus IG in setting of untreated Hepatitis C 
infection.
- Proceed with pain management regimen: Acetaminophen 1000 mg IV QD and 650 mg PO Q4H 
prn for mild pain, Ketorolac 30 mg IV Q8H prn for moderate pain and Hydromorphone 1 mg/mL 
IV Q4H prn for severe pain.

psych provider as she is more informed of his medical history and management. Will consider
psych consult Monday after OR if patient’s anxiety worsens.
