Assessment and Plan:
61 y/o male with a PMHx of HTN, HLD, GERD presenting with one day of abdominal 
pain, nausea and vomiting. 6-8 episodes of vomiting which resolved after ondansetron 
4mg. In the ER, placed on CWAS due to possible ETOH withdraw because the patient 
was seen twice in the ER for ETOH related problems. 0n 9/17/21 he was admitted for 
thrombocytopenia after coming to the ED with ETOH intoxication where it was reported 
he drank 2 small whiskey bottles daily and his son at that time said he had a 3 year Hx 
of ETOX abuse and refuses to get help. On 10/14/18, was also admitted for ETOH 
intoxication. ETOH Negative at 11:33am this morning however per patient last drink was 
yesterday afternoon. Labs in ED concerning for hypokalemia, respiratory alkalosis, 
hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, elevated troponins and transaminitis. CT A/P 
unremarkable. Symptoms likely due to ETOH use given history, tremors on exam 
consistent with withdraw within 24 hours however patient states he has had tremors for 
years. Acute pancreatitis suspicion low due to normal lipase levels. Acute cholelithiasis 
suspicion low due to no association with food and normal bilirubin studies. 
Gastroenteritis is a dx of exclusion and will increase clinical suspicion depending on 
course of symptoms in the hospital. ED course ASA 324mg PO, Ofirmev 1000mg IVPB, 
Zofran 4mg IVP, Protonix 40mg IVP, Ativan 2mg IVP, Mg 2gm IV, Potassium 40meq 
PO + 10meq IV x3
Plan:
#EtOH Withdraw
-Patient on CIWA protocol
-Will start on on thiamine, folic acid
-Peer Recovery specialist
#Hypokalemia
-Expected given history of vomiting
-Given 60 meq
-Last checked prior to administering
-Will re-order
#HTN
-Continual in the 180s-190s/90's-100
-Did not take home BP medications x 1 day
-Will restart on home metoprolol 25mg BID
-Will continue to monitor

#Respiratory alkalosis
-Last checked at 9am
-Patient was not tachypneic on examination now and RR was not measured within 
hours of test
-Could be secondary to withdraw at the time of blood gases, would expect metabolic 
alkalosis with vomiting history
-Will continue to monitor
#Transaminitis
-Given history of ETOH use, LFTs expected to be mildly elevated. No baseline labs. 
Also taking statin medication at home.
-No concerning hepatic findings on exam or CTA
-Will continue to monitor
-Follow up as outpatient
#Hyperglycemia
-Insulin resistance vs ETOH use
-Baseline labs unknown
-Will continue to monitor
#Elevated Troponin
-Only mild elevation at 26
-EKG non-specific changes, low concern for acute cardiac event
-Will trend
#HLD
-Will hold statin for now given LFT elevations
-Follow up as outpatient
