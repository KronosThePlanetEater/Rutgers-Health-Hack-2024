CC: Blurry vision and headache x 1 day
HPI: The patient is a 63 year man with a history of HTN, Hyperlipidemia, CVA in 2013, ESRD on 
regular hemodialysis, Afib, and HFpEF who presents with left eye blurriness and headache.
Two days before admission the patient had cataract surgery in his R. eye and was off coumadin 
for 5 days prior. Following hemodialysis the morning of admission, he began experiencing left 
eye blurriness and headache.. The associated headache was sharp, starting in the front of the 
head and radiating to the left side and back of the head, but consistent with previous headaches 
following HD. His vision improved gradually over the next few hours and was back to baseline 
by the time he was examined. The episode was not accompanied by a facial droop, weakness, 
or loss of sensation. He did not report any jaw claudication, hip pain, or hip stiffness. No fever, 
chills, chest pain, SOB, N/V/D/C.

Assessment & Plan:
63 year old man with a history of HTN, HLD, CVA in 2013, ESRD, Afib, and HFpEF who 
recently held coumadin for 5 days for R. eye cataract surgery presents transient left vision loss 
after dialysis today.
#Left eye blurry vision
Hx is concerning for amaurosis fugax given patient recently stopped coumadin for 5 days and 
INR today is subtherapeutic at 1.3. Giant cell arteritis is less likely given normal ESR, and no 
jaw claudication or temporal tenderness. Given stroke risk factors including previous CVA, 
ESRD on HD, pAfib will start aspirin and increase atorvastatin to 80 mg. Continue TIA workup 
per stroke team with MRI head and MRA head/neck. 
#Paroxysmal Afib
Subtherapeutic INR at 1.3. Continue home regimen of coumadin 3mg QD, start heparin gtt for 
bridge until INR at goal 2-3. C/w metoprolol and amiodarone. Daily INR, monitor closely since 
on amiodarone. 
#ESRD
Received HD morning of admission. Na 133, K 5.1, BUN 33, Cr 8.3. HD ordered for Friday. 
Resume auryxia on discharge.
#Normocytic anemia
Hb 11, trending down from 14 in 4/2021. No obvious blood loss. Continue to monitor CBC daily, 
f/u on iron studies. 
#HTN
C/w metoprolol
#HLD
Started on Atorvastatin 80mg QD - increased from 40 QD
F: none
E: replete PRN
N: regular diet
P: coumadin, heparin gtt
