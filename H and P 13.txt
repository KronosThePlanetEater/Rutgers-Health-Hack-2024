
CC: Chest pain, dyspnea on exertion 
HPI: The Patient is a 58-year-old female who, aside from CHF and ACS, was in her usual state of 
health until one month ago when she noticed worsening dyspnea on exertion accompanied by 
substernal left-sided pressure while climbing a flight of stairs. It resolved within five minutes of 
rest. She then checked her hands and feet for swelling and found swelling in her hands 
bilaterally. She relayed her symptoms to Dr. Iyer who directed her to take extra doses of 
torsemide and spironolactone. This helped for a few days until symptoms returned. She does 
not weigh herself regularly but estimates a 4 lbs. weight gain in the past month. She normally 
can walk 3 blocks before feeling winded, though her exercise tolerance had reduced to 1 block 
in the week leading up to her admission. She has recently added a third pillow to help her sleep 
at night. She has not experienced radiating pain to her jaw/shoulder, nausea, vomiting, fever, 
or chills. She has not changed her diet or level of activity and is diligent with medication 
adherence. 
Dr. Iyer told her to come to the ED because her DOE and typical angina have not resolved with 
outpatient diuresis. In the ED she received furosemide i.v. 40 mg at 1300 last night and 0600 
today. Her urine output has not been measured but she woke up to urinate ~5 times. When I 
saw her this afternoon, she described an overnight headache which had resolved and improving 
dyspnea since starting furosemide. She feels her hand swelling has come down but notes new 
abdominal distension. She told me that previous CHF exacerbations have been accompanied by 
hepatic congestion.

Assessment & Plan 
Patient is 58-year-old female with PMH including HFrEF, CAD s/p PCI to RCA, and HTN 
presenting with 1 month history of worsening dyspnea on exertion and typical angina. She has 
been in sinus tachycardia with negative troponin X3 and her symptoms have improved with 
diuresis in ED, though she still experiences SOB and substernal chest pain. We need to admit 
her for CHF exacerbation and to rule out P/E (in setting of malignancy) vs. ACS. 
1. Orthopnea, edema, slight weight gain: Most likely an acute on chronic CHFrEF 
exacerbation. Unclear etiology as she doesn’t recall recent illness, changes in 
diet/activity or issues with medication adherence. This may be the natural progression 
of her diastolic CHF and we should conduct a trans-thoracic echocardiogram to assess if 
there has been a change from her baseline. 
2. Dyspnea on exertion and chest pain: ACS vs PE. Absence of ST elevations, troponins and
unstable angina rules out STEMI, NSTEMI, and unstable angina. We need a CTA of chest 
to rule out PE. If no PE is evident, this likely represents worsening stable angina in the 
setting of her CHF exacerbation 
3. Sinus tachycardia: Could be 2° to HCF exacerbation, PE, ACS, or anxiety. Patient did not 
sleep well last night, and is nervous in ED. 
4. DM II: hold home meds, start insulin glargine 40 units BID, lispro 30 units TID 
5. HTN: controlled on admission with systolic pressure in 130s. Continue home hydralazine 
50 mg PO TID 
6. OSA: CPAP helps her sleep at home. We should set her up with CPAP during admission 
to provide for her comfort, and to avoid a bump in her systolic blood pressure. 
7. HLD: continue home atorvastatin 80 mg QD
8. Gerd: continue home omeprazole 40 mg po BID 
9. Stage II breast cancer s/p l total mastectomy 6/2017: Home letrozole 2.5 mg po QD not 
in hospital formulary. She needs to arrange for someone to bring it in. Because she lives 
at home alone, we should speak with her to make sure she has adequate social support 
to make this feasible. Continue to follow with Dr. Omena
10. Colon cancer s/p colectomy 2012: Home tramadol 50 mg po Q6hr PRN. Continue to 
follow up with Dr. Malhotra
11. Chronic IDA: Hb 12.2, MCV 85, which is stable for her. 
12. Insomnia: continue home trazadone 150 mg po QHS, zolpidem 10 mg QHS. 
FENP: None / replete PRN / NPO pending possible cath / enoxaparin 
Code status: Full code.
